Discord FAQ
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
I need an invite link to the Discord Server. How do I get it?
For a variety of reasons, we don't use normal Discord invite links to add students to our server. All CCI students received an email in Fall 2021 which included a link to our sign-up page
For understandable reasons, you may have not checked your email and it got buried or you accidentally deleted and cannot find it now
No worries! Just join here and share with your CCI friends!
Visit this page if you have any issue joining the server
How do I join my course server?
Courses do not have their own servers managed by CCI, instead they have ""categories"" which act as a bucket for various text channels courses are using. You can find your course categories by scrolling down the list of channels past the CLC
As of January 2022, the only course that CCI officially provides a server to is CCI Senior Design
CST Senior Design and all CCI courses conduct Discord activities in our primary server labeled CCI @ Drexel University
Course category access is assigned automatically starting after finals week and through out the start of the quarter. You do not have to do anything to gain access other than make sure you are enrolled
I don't see all my classes in the Discord server?
This server is only for CCI courses. Courses such as Math, Sciences, Art, or any other non-CCI course will not have a category in our server 
Not every course at CCI uses our Discord server. Using Discord for courses is up to the discretion of each professor, therefore sometimes only certain sections will be using Discord
You may have registered late (After the end of finals week). Discord is not a Drexel owned service, and processing course enrollments take time in Discord. If you register for a course after finals week (During break week, week 1, etc) you may not have access to course categories until days after you register 
I am registered for CCI courses that should be using Discord but I don't see the categories?
There are more reasons that you might not see all courses that are using Discord even if you are registered on time. This page has a list of the most common reasons why you may be unable to find your categories along with solutions to try
Can non-CCI students join the CCI Discord?
Non-CCI students can only join the CCI Discord if they are taking a CCI course, and it has to be a CCI course that uses Discord.
Otherwise, non-CCI students are not allowed to join the CCI Discord."

ListServ
If you do not already have a ListServ account, or have never used ListServ before, please review the DU IT documentation on Mass Email Lists.
Lists for mass mailing can be requested by emailing ihelp@drexel.edu and requesting a new ListServ List.  Existing list change requests can also be submitted. ListServ lists are created by IRT, and it may take up to 1 business day from the time we send the request to IRT for the list to be created.  Lists are usually created much quicker, however wait time may vary depending on the ListServ team's workload.  
Please note that unless we are told otherwise, the requestor will be the primary list owner/manager, and will be responsible for keeping the subscribers list up to date. CCI IT will not update subscriber emails for a ListServ unless asked to do so by the list manager/owner. For more info on managing a ListServ, visit the DU IT website to read their documentation.
Before we can create a list we must know the following information:
List Name
The name of your list will also be part of its email address. In most cases, the prefix ""CCI"" will be added to the beginning of all CCI lists to make them easier to identify.

List Type (Who should be able to email the list?)
Owners - Only designated owners can email the list
Subscribers - All subscribers can email the list
Public - Anyone can email the list.  If a list is set to public it is strongly recommended that the list is also configured to require the user sending an email to confirm that email.  This will help prevent the list from being spammed.
 
List Owners
Email addresses of all list owners.
 
Errors and Replies
Errors To: The email address errors should be sent to. Default is the list owner.
Reply To: Can be a specified email address, or the list itself (if list type is Discussion or Moderated). Default is message sender.

List Subscribers(Members)
Names and email addresses of all list Subscribers.  If you do not have this information now you can send it to ihelp@drexel.edu once the list has been created"

https://support.cci.drexel.edu/getting-connected/discord/discord-friends-list/,Discord Friends List,"Contact The CCI Helpdesk
Discord Friends List
The Discord friends list is like a list of contacts that you can communicate with without having to share a server.
Adding a user to your friends list
If you share a server
If you share a server with someone, adding them to your friends list is easy. Right click on their profile picture or username, and select ""Add Friend."" This will send them a friend request.

Alternatively, open up their profile by clicking their profile picture or username, then clicking their profile picture again in the menu that comes up.

Once you are viewing their full profile, there will be a big green ""Send Friend Request"" icon.

If you do not share a server
You will need to have the user's tag, which looks like ""Username#1234"". You can get your own tag by clicking your username in the bottom-left corner of the screen. This will copy the tag, and then you can paste it anywhere.

Once you have someone's tag, you can send them a request from the friends list. To get there, first click the Discord logo in the top-left corner of the screen, and then select Friends if it isn't already selected.

At the top of this list, there will be a button for ""Add Friend""

Type in their tag and hit ""Send Friend Request"". Note that this is case-sensitive, so if possible, copy-paste their tag in directly.

Receiving a friend request
When you receive a friend request, it will show up as a notification badge on the Discord logo in the top-left corner.

Click it, select ""Friends,"" and go to ""Pending.""

There you will see their profile picture and username. If you recognize them, you can go ahead and click the checkmark to accept.

If not, click their profile picture to pull up this screen, where you can click through to view any servers you share with them and any mutual friends.

Under mutual servers, it will also show their nicknames on those servers, which might help you recognize them.

Note that if you don't have any mutual servers or mutual friends, and you did not give anyone your tag, there's a chance that it may be a scammer, though this is rare.

The ""Active Now"" panel
To the right of the friends list, you may see a list for ""Active Now."" This will show some friends that are currently playing games.

You will be able to see what game they've been playing and for how long. Note that this will only show if they have the setting enabled for it and are online."

Connecting to dragonfly3 WiFi on Android
Introduction
Connecting to dragonfly3 on an Android device is a trickier than on other devices, but still easily done once you know how.
Manual Configuration Instructions
For Android, the manual configuration is actually faster, easier, and more dependable than the using the Dragonfly3 installation wizard.
If you already connected to dragonfly3 before,
enter your Android settings
& forget any existing dragonfly3 network in your saved networks.
If you are not sure how to forget dragonly3, see the section further below on this.
Get onto the drexelguest WiFi network. Visit http://neverssl.com in a web browser if you are not automatically redirected to the drexelguest login portal. Only need to enter your email address there.
Click the dragonfly3 installation wizard. Follow the instructions.
If it succeeds, proceed no further!
If it fails...
do the following.
Open ""Android Setting""s app.
Or swipe down once, and then again,
and click the cog or gear icon
to get to ""Settings.""
Tap ""Network & Internet"" or ""Internet"" (or like).
Find & edit the drafgonfly3 network settings.
For ""network name"" or ""SSID"", enter the following:

dragonfly3

For EAP method, use PEAP.
For Phase 2 authentication, use MSCHAPV2.
For CA Certificate, select the first option mentions ""dragonfly3"" somehow.

If this doesn't work, select ""Use System Certificates."" It may help for the ""CA certificate"" to download it from link below & select (despite what we say above) from https://drexel.edu/it/help/a-z/dragonfly3/generic_config/ . If that doesn't help, try selecting ""unspecified"" or ""no choice"" or ""do not choose"" or not choosing any option or the ""CA certificate"" option.

You may also need to choose a different option under ""Online Certification Status"" then ""Do not verify,"" if prompted, but try that first.

For domain, specify ""drexel.edu"" (without quotes).
For identity, use your Drexel userid.
For Anonymous identity, leave it blank.
For password, use your Drexel password.
Click Next repeatedly, and then Done, to accept changes.
For further help, see the manual configuration of dragonfly 3 page at https://drexel.edu/it/help/a-z/dragonfly3/generic_config/

The following screenshots give a good idea of what to select,
BUT you may need to choose a different options for the certficate fields.

Papercut -- Cannot Print to Black & White or CCIBW or BW
Tagged with: papercut printing
When printing to the black and white queue on PaperCut, you may come across an error (similar but not exact results to the photo) where the page shows up as a glitched color page. Other glitches may also occur. This problem happens often in Chrome since it defaults the browser to print in color despite choosing to print in black and white. This issue can occur when trying to print to CCIBW - the PaperCut black and white printer.

In order to fix this error:
The web browser should have an option (most likely dropdown menu but others as well) to ask if you want to print in color or black and white.
Select to print in black and white for the black and white printer.
When printing black and white to the PaperCut black and white printers, CCIBW, double check that the web browser is set to print in black and white."

iOS MFA notification/Sign In
We (Drexel ITG) have discovered a minor issue with iOS users trying to sign into Drexel-provided apps. These apps include Health Checker and Blackboard. It is important, if you are using push notifications from the Microsoft Authenticator app as your default method of multi-factor authentication (MFA), that you swipe down on the banner notification and select Approve. If you only tap the notification, it will bring you into the Authenticator app and might not pass the approval to the Drexel-provided app.
To prevent missing the notification, set your banner style notification for the Microsoft Authenticator app to Persistent.
To do this, on your device go to Settings (Device Settings) > Authenticator > Notifications > set Banner Style to Persistent.
If you continue to have issues signing in despite these steps, you can turn off App Lock within Microsoft Authenticator. Microsoft Authenticator > Triple bar (upper left corner) > Settings > toggle App Lock to the Off position. Note that turning off App Lock will now allow you to use the Authenticator without FaceID, TouchID, or passcode, but you might want to consider re-enabling it in the future.

Gitlab Fix for ""Access Denied"" Error -- Windows
""Access denied"" issues can be solved by removing your cached credentials. Basically, Git likes to save a copy of your username and password the first time you try to connect to a Git site, and if you change your password on Gitlab, you need to reset your stored credentials.
To remove them, you can follow the second response (with 240 upvotes) at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15381198/remove-credentials-from-git


Once your credentials are cleared, you can try logging in again, and make sure to use your abc123 username and Tux password (not their DrexelOne password)."

Tagged with: faculty website
The CCI Webserver that hosted faculty websites was recently retired.  All the hosted websites have been moved to a Linux environment.  Your site is now hosted on tux.cs.drexel.edu.  You can connect to the server using any ftp client. 
FileZilla is a popular client if you need one https://filezilla-project.org/  If you are not familiar with using FileZilla there is a full article here that describes how to use file zilla. 
If you are using this article as a guide please be sure that you are using the host, username and password specified below since the linked article is a general guide.
When connecting to tux to edit your faculty website you can use your Drexel username and password.  Your username must include @drexel.edu, see example below
To connect via sftp please use the following details
Host: sftp://tux.cs.drexel.edu
Username:  abc123@drexel.edu [Your username including @drexel.edu]
Password: [Your Drexel Password]
Once you are connected you will see a directory called ‘public_html’ this is where the contents of your site are hosted. 
If you would like you can also connect via ssh and modify files using vi/vim, etc… To connected to the server via ssh use the following command
Ssh abc123@drexel.edu@tux.cs.drexel.edu
Once you are prompted for your password enter your Drexel password.
Once logged in you will be brought to your home directory.  The public_html folder that contains your website is in your home directory.  "

Discord -- View user profiles
Accessing a user profile
There are two ways to do this. Left click on a user's avatar or username to bring up this menu:

This will show some basic information, including their roles, status, about me, username, and notes. To access their full profile, click the avatar in that menu.

Alternatively, you can right click on their avatar or username, and then select ""Profile"" in the menu that appears.

Viewing the profile
The profile looks like this:

By clicking below NOTE, you can add a note for this user. Only you can see it, and it shows up regardless of server.

If you click Mutual Servers, you will see a list of all servers you share with them. This will also show their nicknames in those servers, so it's helpful to keep track of who's who across multiple servers or in DMs.

Clicking on a server in this list will take you to that server.

If you click Mutual Friends, you will see a list of everyone on your friends list who is also on their friends list, even if you are not friends with the person whose profile you're viewing.

Clicking a user on the Mutual Friends list will take you to their profile.

In the top-right corner, there will be a green button. If this person is on your friends list, as in the screenshot, it will say ""Send Message"". This will take you into a DM. Otherwise, it will say ""Add Friend"" and will send a friend request.

Next to the green button is a menu icon (three vertical dots.) Clicking it will allow you to access more options. You can click Block to block them, which hides all messages they send (and removes them from your friends list,) or click Message to send them a DM. If they are on your friends list, you can also click ""Remove Friend"" to remove them from your friends list.

Additional info
Sometimes, a user will have additional info on their profile. Immediately below their username, there may be a message. This is their status, which is set by them.

Under the ""User Info"" tab, they may have an ""About Me"" section as well.

If they linked accounts from other services they will show up underneath the note section.

A user playing a game that Discord recognizes will have an ""Activity"" tab as well, where the game will be listed.

Tags, Usernames, and Nicknames
When you view someone's profile, the name that appears is often different from the name you see in chat. This name is their username, which is the same regardless of what server they're in.

The name that you see in chat is their nickname, which can be set individually in each server. Note that in the Drexel CCI server, nicknames are set automatically upon joining and cannot be changed by the users.

A tag is a username followed by a # symbol and four digits. These digits are typically randomized to ensure uniqueness, but users who purchase Discord Nitro can customize this (as long as it remains unique.)

In the above example, the username is ""bjb344"", the tag is ""bjb344#9755"", and the nickname is ""Brian Bijeau""."

Discord -- Threads
Threads are like miniature temporary channels stored within another channel.
Creating a thread
You can create a thread from an existing message or from scratch.
From an existing message
If there is an existing message you want to create a thread off of, hover over it, and click the thread icon that appears (a # symbol with a speech bubble overtop.)

When you click it, you will be shown this menu, where you can name the thread, set the archive timer, and create the thread.

The message you create the thread from will be the first message in the thread. The thread itself will show up below the message, like so:

From scratch
You can create a thread without an existing message by clicking the + icon in the message bar. There will be an option to create a thread.

Clicking it will bring up this version of the thread creation menu. You will have to name the thread and create the first message, and you may set the archive timer. Click ""Create thread"" when ready.

This will create a notification for the thread in the channel, as shown:

Finding threads
When a channel has at least one active thread, its icon will change to include a speech bubble. Any threads you have joined will appear underneath the channel, like so:

Hovering over a channel will also show active threads you have not joined.
There will also be a thread icon at the top of the screen, allowing you to browse all threads in the channel.

Threads you are in will appear on top, followed by threads you have not joined.

You can also push the ""Archived"" tab to view archived threads.

Joining threads
You will not be notified for messages in threads you have not joined.
You can join a thread by sending a message in it, or by hitting the ""Join"" button at the top.

If you mention someone (@<their name>) from within a thread, they will be added to the thread automatically.
Note that each thread has its own notification settings. For details on notification settings, see the following:
Discord Notifications
Leaving threads
Right clicking a thread will show ""Leave thread"" among the options.

You can also leave a thread through the ""..."" menu at the top:

Viewing threads
A thread may appear in either Split View or Full View.
Split View
Clicking a thread from within a channel will cause it to appear in Split View, side-by-side with the main channel.

From here you can use the ""..."" menu to switch to Full View. Selecting Search or Pins will also do this. You can also hit the X to exit Split View and return to the main channel.

Full View
Clicking a thread in the channel list or thread list will cause it to appear in Full View, as if it were its own channel.

Note that the member list will only show users who have joined that thread.
From here you can use the ""..."" menu to switch to Split View.
Jumping to the original message
If a thread is created from a message, the first message in the thread will have a ""Jump"" button, like so:

Clicking this button will take you to the original message in the main channel.
Archiving threads
By default, a thread will be archived after 24 hours of inactivity.
An archived thread will not appear in the channel list or the Active portion of the threads list, but it still appears below the original message (if it still exists) and the Archived portion of the threads list.
Changing the archive timer
A thread may be modified to be archived after only one hour of inactivity. In a Nitro-boosted server, longer durations may be available too.
You have the option to set this timer when you create the thread. You may also change it afterwards from ""..."" menu:

(The """"LVL 1"" and ""LVL 2"" notes here mean that those options require the server to be Nitro-boosted.)
Archiving or unarchiving directly
A thread can be archived from the ""..."" menu by clicking the ""Archive Thread"" option.

You may unarchive a thread by sending a message in it, or by clicking the ""Unarchive"" button at the top:"

Gitlab Basics
What is Gitlab?
Gitlab is a service managed by CCI for collaboration and versioning of small project files, especially for source code. It is available to all CCI students, faculty and staff. 
Logging in
To log into Gitlab, visit https://gitlab.cci.drexel.edu in your web browser of choice, and select the Sign in with DrexelConnect login method. 

Once logged in, you should be directed to your Projects page. This will be empty to begin with, but as you create projects they will become available here.


Installing Git client
Windows: Visit Installing Git client on Windows
Linux: Use your distro's package manager to install git, eg. yum install git or apt-get install git.
macOS: open the Terminal from Applications > Utilities and run the command git --version. macOS will prompt you to install the command line development tools if they're not installed yet.

Configuring SSH key authentication
SSH key-based authentication is the most secure and recommended way of connecting to Gitlab from all Git clients. 
First, you'll need to create an SSH key for your computer. First, launch your terminal as follows:
Windows: open the Start menu and open ""Git Bash"" from the ""Git"" program group (Git must be installed following the earlier instructions first)
macOS: open Terminal.app from Applications > Utilities
Linux: Log into a server over SSH, or find the terminal app for your distribution from the app launcher from your distribution.
Once you have a command line open, run the command ssh-keygen and follow the prompts. You should accept the default location for the key by pressing the Enter or Return key. For increased security, you can also provide a password, which will be required each time you log into Git; leave the prompt empty and press the Enter or Return key to avoid setting a password.

Next, we need to copy the public key for your SSH key pair to add it to our project in Gitlab. This can be retrieved by running the command cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub from your home folder:

Select this string of text with the mouse, and copy:
Windows (Git Bash): select text, right click, and choose ""Copy""
Windows (PuTTY): Select text and it will automatically be copied to the clipboard
Windows (CMD/PowerShell): Select text and press the Enter key to copy to the clipboard
Mac: select text and use command-c to copy the text
Linux: This depends on how you're connected to Linux. Linux GUI terminals will differ, but generally you can select text and use the Edit menu to copy the text. If you're connected by SSH, use the method above for the client you're connecting from.
Add the key to Gitlab:
Next, log into the Gitlab web interface. When you log in, you should see a menu in the top right of the screen. Click this menu and choose ""Settings"" to get to your Settings page.

From the Settings page, click the first key icon which has a label of ""SSH Keys""

In the window that opens, you can paste your SSH key and give it a description. Click ""Add key"" and you should be ready to use SSH key-based authentication with your Gitlab account.
 
Creating a Project
Once you've configured your computer to access Gitlab, you'll need to set up a project to store your files. First, log into the Gitlab web interface, and you should start at your Projects page. Click ""New project"" to open the New Project page.

On the new project page, you must set a name for your project. The project URL will be automatically generated, as will the ""project slug"". You can also set a description, and should choose the appropriate security level for your project. Private projects will only allow access to yourself and users you specifically choose. Internal projects can be seen by anyone who logs into Gitlab. Public projects can be seen by everyone. You can also choose to include a README file, which will keep you from getting a warning when you clone an empty project.


Cloning a Project
Cloning a project creates a copy of the files associated with it on your local computer. To clone the repository, visit your project in your Web browser and click the ""Clone"" drop-down button. From the options that come up, copy the string under ""Clone with SSH"" into your clipboard, and follow the Mac, Linux, or Windows instructions below.

Open the terminal application you used to generate an SSH key earlier, and use the cd command to move to the folder where you want your project to be stored. Run the command git clone followed by the string of text you copied from the Gitlab window earlier, and press Return or Enter. Your computer may ask if it's okay to connect to Gitlab if you haven't connected before - accept the SSH host key and your project repository should be copied to your local machine.


Adding Files to a Project
Within the Terminal application you used earlier, use cd to move to your project folder. Create a new file in this folder using any application, in my example below I used the Vim text editor. Once the file is saved, you can run ls to ensure that the file is there. To tell Git to track your file, run the command git add followed by the name of your file. You can then run the command git commit -a to commit your changes, and git push to upload the changes to the Gitlab server. Future changes can be uploaded to Gitlab by running the commands git commit -a  and git push again.


Getting updated files from Gitlab 
Within the Terminal application you used earlier, use cd to move to your project folder. Run the command git pull to retrieve the latest changes from the Gitlab server. If you've made any changes locally, you should first run the commands git commit -a  and git push to ensure that Gitlab is up to date and in sync with all changes."

Direct Messages in Discord
A Direct Message (or DM for short, sometimes referred to as a Private Message or PM) is a message directly from the sender to the recipient, not connected to any server. DMs cannot be viewed by anyone except the sender and the recipient, and exist in a special channel for this purpose.
How to start a Direct Message
There are several ways to do this. The quickest is to click on the recipient's profile image or username to bring up this menu:

Type your message in the text box on the bottom, and then hit enter, and it will send.
Alternatively, right-click on the user and select ""Message"" to open the DM channel directly.

If the recipient is in your friends list, then you can also open the channel from there. Click the Discord logo in the top-left corner and select ""Friends"".

Find the recipient on the list (you may have to switch from ""Online"" to ""All"" at the top) and click the speech bubble icon to open the DM channel.

If you have already have a DM channel with the recipient, they will appear under ""Direct Messages"" on the left sidebar after you click the Discord logo in the top-left corner. Click them there to open the DM channel.

If your Direct Message won't send
Sometimes, when sending a Direct Message, you'll receive this error.

The first thing to check is whether you share a server with the recipient. If you scroll up to the top of the channel, you should see this header. In this case, you can see 1 mutual server with the recipient in the bottom-left.

If you do not share a server, you will see this instead:

In this case, you can send a friend request to the recipient by clicking the button, but unless they accept, you won't be able to DM them. For more information, see the following:
Discord Friends List
If you do share a server with the recipient, then they may have blocked you, or they may have disabled receiving DMs from members of that server. If they blocked you, then you won't be able to DM them.
If they disabled DMs from server members, then you can get around it by adding them to your friends list, or you can ask them to re-enable DMs from server members.
Disabling (or enabling) Direct Messages from server members
If you do not want to receive DMs from server members, you can disable them. Right-click the server in the server list on the left to bring up this menu:

Select ""Privacy Settings"" to bring up this screen. Click the green checkmark to switch it to an X, disabling DMs from server members. Click it again to switch it back on if you change your mind.

Receiving a Direct Message
When you receive a DM, it will always notify you as if somebody pinged you (@Your Name). The DM itself will appear as an icon at the top of your server list, with a badge showing how many unread messages you have:

Click the icon to view the DM and remove the notification. Note that you can mute a DM by right-clicking on it and selecting mute, and this will prevent additional notifications from showing up, but existing notifications will remain there until you read them or mark them as read.
Creating a Group Direct Message
There are three ways to create a group DM, which allows multiple people to send direct messages to each other. Note that all participants in a group DM must be on your friends list, but they do not have to be friends with each other.
The first is to go to your Discord home (by clicking the Discord logo in the top-left corner.) Then in the top-right corner, there will be a button for ""New Group DM""

You can pull up the same menu via the + button next to ""Direct Messages"" in the sidebar on the left.

From this menu, you can scroll through your friends list and click the check boxes on the right to add people to the group DM. You can also type their names in the text box at the top to search for them.

When you finish, click the big blue ""Create Group DM"" button to create it.

Alternatively, if you already have a DM and wish to make it into a group DM, you can add friends to it via the icon in the top-right. This will bring up the same menu."

Unable to find Discord Course Categories
Course Registration
We have a Discord bot that helps assign course roles (which gives you access to your categories) but we have to give our bot a class list from from a specific point in time. This means you may be registered for a course in Drexel's systems but we have not yet gotten a new class list to give our bot. If your class has an assignment due using our Discord server, make your professor aware of your registration date and you are still waiting for access based on the below times:
If you have been registered for the course since the Friday of finals week you should see access to these categories over the course of break week or by the end of the first day of week 1
If you registered for a course over break week you will have access by the Friday of break week or by the end of the first day of week 1
If you register for a course after the quarter has started, please wait 48 hours after registering for access to your course categories. During the quarter, student class lists are updated on: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of week 1 and  Monday and Wednesday of week 2 *Please wait until after 5pm of each day to see your categories appear*
If you still do not see your course category and it is passed when access is expected, email ihelp@drexel.edu and attach a copy of your schedule along with the section number of your class
Joined the Server With a Normal Discord Link
Some people have joined our server through a regular one time use Discord link, which prevents roles from being assigned with our bot
If you know you did not join our server through our sign-up page, please leave the Discord server and rejoin through the sign-up page
Once rejoined, your course roles will be applied and you can see your course categories
If you have issues joining see this page for possible solutions
Multiple Accounts in the Server
There are cases where people may have joined our server on one Discord account, then joined again with a different account
Only your last joined account gets your course roles assigned. If you suspect you may have multiple accounts joined to our server, leave the server on all of your accounts, then rejoin at our sign-up page with the account you want to use in our server
If you cannot leave the server on all your accounts, that is also ok, just rejoin at our sign-up page with the account you want to use in our server
Can Only See Some Enrolled Courses
Only courses offered by CCI are using our Discord server. You will not find math, science, or other non-CCI courses here
Not every CCI course is using our server

Why Not Use Self Service for Mac?
If you have Self Service for Mac installed (which all instructors and staff with Macs should), you can definitely install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN application from there easily while on-campus at Drexel.
However, off-campus users must first connect to the Drexel network using the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client to use Self Service for Mac to install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client. It's a classic paradox or catch-22.
To avoid that, the instructions below explain how to install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client without using Self Service for Mac.
Note that the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client updates itself when it first connects.

Printing to Papercut with Linux
Printing to PaperCut from Linux requires that your Linux username match your Drexel or Tux username; if it does not, your print jobs will not be assigned to your queue and cannot be retrieved. Adding the PaperCut printers is as simple as running the following commands. The generic PPD file we use can be downloaded at PaperCut Generic PPD for Linux.
For systems that use Drexel or Tux credentials, use the following commands:

lpadmin -p ""CCI-BW"" -E -v 'lpd://papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20BW' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd
lpadmin -p ""CCI-Color"" -E -v 'lpd://papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20Color' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd

For systems using nonstandard usernames, you must add your Drexel or Tux username in the command, replacing <<userid>> in the following commands:

lpadmin -p ""CCI-BW"" -E -v 'lpd://<<userid>>@papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20BW' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd
lpadmin -p ""CCI-Color"" -E -v 'lpd://<<userid>>@papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20Color' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd

Tagged with: MFA General Authentication Info
Info on MFA
DUIT's website below does a great job helping with 1st time set-up.
https://drexel.edu/it/help/a-z/multi-factor-auth/
CHECK THE ""Do not ask again for 60 days"" CHECKBOX, when prompted.
Aside from the VPN, most applications and websites that ask for your Drexel MFA
will give you an option to not be asked for your MFA again for 2 months (60 days).
UNLESS you are on a public computer, or someone else's computer. 
Do NOT check this then.
Optional - Microsoft Authenticator App
The Microsoft Authenticator App can be installed on Android or iOS.
It is a great method of authentication.

Many people find the app easier to use once set up than text message and phone call. 

You can approve/deny MFA requests on Apple iWatch, once this is set-up on a connected iPhone.
How to Install and Configure the Authenticator App
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-microsoft-authenticator-with-microsoft-365-1412611f-ad8d-43ab-807c-7965e5155411#ID0EBBH=_Step_1
How to Use The Authenticator App
Login to some Office 365 app or in portal.office.com.
*Remember* to check the box to allow the device for 60 days (if prompted - no prompt with VPN).
So you don’t have to keep authenticating.
Do NOT do this if you are on a public computer or someone else’s device!
When prompted to approve access using MFA,
look for a notification on your phone.

If you do not see a notification,
open the app on your phone,
click into the account for Drexel or your Drexel email,
& click any refresh or circling arrow icons.

Tap ""Approve.""

Printing and Copying with PaperCut Printers
Tagged with: papercut copy print
Printing from PaperCut is very similar to printing normally, but there are some minor differences. These instructions apply to Macs, PCs, iOS and Android devices, as well as Chrome OS systems.
The first difference you'll notice when printing is that you no longer have separate printers for the different copy rooms - now, the only printers you will see are the ""CCI Color"" and ""CCI BW"" printers. Instead of printing to a specific printer, you simply choose whether you want to print in black and white or in color. You can then walk to either printer and release your print job.

When printing from a Drexel Mac or PC, you can access advanced printing options just as you have in the past, for finishing options such as stapling and sorting.
After submitting a print job, you may be asked for your Drexel username and password. This will ensure that only you can print your documents when you get to the printer.

Once you've submitted your print job, and possibly authenticated with your Drexel credentials, you can go to either copy room to print your documents. Most faculty and staff have already been imported into the system and will be able to simply scan their DragonCard to log in, as shown below; you can also log in with your Drexel credentials if you don't have your card.

If your card is not recognized, you will be asked to log in using your Drexel credentials. This will record your card number so you can scan your card in the future.

Once logged into PaperCut, you can choose ""Print Release"" or ""Access Device"", as shown below:

To print things you have submitted to the queue, choose ""Print Release"". This will bring you to your personal print queue, where you can choose to print documents you have submitted to the print queue. You can also choose to print as grayscale or convert a print to two-sided printing if desired.

To use the copier as a copier or scanner, choose ""Access Device"". This will give you the copier's standard interface, as you may have used before.

You have to modify the permissions on /private/tmp (tmp folder get info). So that all users have ""read / write"" privileges. More then ""system"" needs ""read / write."" If Admin has ""read,"" it needs ""read / write."" If Everyone has ""read,"" it needs ""read / write. Basically, change privileges for all users to ""read/write."" That will fix it.

Note that this is for the server list.
For the list of channels in a server, see Discord -- Server Navigation Bar
Discord Home
At the top of the far left navigation bar is the Discord logo. Clicking this will take you to the home page, which is most useful for the friends list and direct messages. For more information, see the following:
Discord Friends List
Direct Messages in Discord
There is also a button for stages. Stages are large public voice chats that you can listen in on. Current speakers will be listed underneath the stage name, and clicking on it will add you to the audience. This also temporarily adds you to the server, but you will be removed once you leave the stage and open another server.
Server List
Below the Discord logo, you will see a list of all servers you are currently in. Clicking a server in this list will take you to your last viewed channel in said server. For more information on navigating a server, see the following:
Discord -- Server Navigation Bar
You can also right click on a server to access settings which are also detailed in the above. See Top Menu. It's a different way of reaching them, but the settings are mostly the same.
Arranging Servers
You can click and drag servers within the list to arrange them in whatever order you see fit.

You can also group servers together into folders. To do this, drag one server on top of another. If you hold it there for about a second, the server underneath will shrink to indicate that you're creating a folder. Once you let go, the folder will be made.

Click on a folder to expand it and access individual servers within. Click the folder icon again to collapse it. Folders can be arranged like servers.

Right click on a folder (collapsed or icon) to access folder settings, allowing you to choose a name for it or change its color.
 
To remove a folder, expand it, then move all of the servers out of the folder. Once it is empty, it will be removed automatically.
Add a Server
There are two icons on the bottom left for adding new servers.
The first is a plus sign, which allows you to create a server. It also has a button that lets you join an existing server if you have an invite.
The second is a compass, which allows you to explore public servers. Covered further down in ""Explore Public Serves.""
Creating a Server
When you create a server, you will be able to choose a template. Alternatively, you can use ""Create My Own"" to start with the most basic server: one text channel and one voice channel. None of this is permanent, it just determines what channels you start with.
After that, it will ask if the server is for a community or just friends. In most cases, it's best to select friends or skip the question.
It will then ask you for a name for the server, and give you the opportunity to upload a server icon. When you're happy with it, click the ""Create"" button.

Introduction:
This is a brief guide on getting connected to the dragonfly3 connection for Linux computers with a GUI such as xfce4, or some other GUI libraries. In order to connect to dragonfly3, please ensure that you are on campus, and are in range of the network.
Getting Connection:
You will need to connect to drexelguest first before you can connect to dragonfly3. The reason why you should do this is so that you can get the installation wizard for Linux. Here's the instructions below on getting connected:
Connect to Drexel Guest
You may get prompted to go to a website of unsecure connection - proceed through it normally


Navigate to: https://drexel.edu/it/help/a-z/dragonfly3/, and scroll down until you see the ""Dragonfly3 configuration parameters

Here, you will see the required parameters in order to connect to dragonfly3 (This is important for adding the network)

Now, create a new WiFi connection - some windows may not show, so please check to make sure you have the correct one selected to pop up.

Click on the ""Plus"" button on the ""Network Connections"" pop up.

Make sure to select the connection type as ""Wi-Fi""

Periodically swapping back and forth tabs with the parameters page can help! You can get back to the configuration by clicking on the ""Editing Wi-Fi connectio..."" at the bottom.

This is what needs to be filled out in the Wi-Fi configuration"

https://support.cci.drexel.edu/getting-connected/gitlabgithub/installing-git-client-windows/,GitLab -- Installing Git Client on Windows,"Contact The CCI Helpdesk
GitLab -- Installing Git Client on Windows
To use Git on Windows, you need to install a third-party program which has many configuration options. The following instructions will help you get the Git client installed and working.
First, download the Git client from https://git-scm.com/download/win. Once it's downloaded, run the installer.
Once the installer launches, you'll be asked to agree to the GNU GPL. You'll need to accept this in order to install Git.

Next, the Git installer will ask if you want to install additional components. The features you need most will likely already be selected, but these are the choices we made when installing:

The next dialog box asks you which editor you'd like to use for Git commits. The default is Vim, which is great for people familiar with Unix; if you are not familiar with Vim, it may be a good idea to choose your preferred editor from the list.

The next step asks you to choose the path settings for Git. The path allows other applications and the Windows command line to access the git tools. Unless you know that you want the UNIX tools in your path, you probably want the default setting.

The next setting you can change is the SSH client being used for the connection to Gitlab. Again, most people probably want to use the default setting of built-in OpenSSH unless you know for certain that you would prefer to use the SSH connection from PuTTY or TortoiseSVN. This setting will not change anything about how you connect to Tux, and your Tux configuration in PuTTY will not change anything about how you connect to Gitlab.

Next, the installer will ask you which SSL method you'd like to use to connect to Git servers. At CCI, we don't use any of the advanced features in the Windows Secure Channel library, so it's best to select OpenSSL.

The next setting allows you to decide how files are checked in and out on Windows. Because Windows formats text files differently than Unix (eg Mac and Tux), it's best to select the first option, to check files out in Windows format and convert them to Unix format when uploading to the server.

The next option you're given is which terminal to use for the command-line Git interface. While it can be used with the built-in command prompt, the included (default) terminal it'll install gives some nice features and is recommended for most users.

Next, you'll be asked to decide what options to use when you issue the pull command. The default choice of ""fast-forward or merge"" is the safest choice.

In the next screen, you can choose a credential manager. This isn't strictly required, but the default option of ""Git credential manager"" is a safe choice.

In the second to last options screen, we can choose to enable file system caching and symlinks. File system caching can speed things up at commit, push and pull time, so it should be enabled. Symlink support shouldn't be necessary.

The final option is to install experimental features. These can be buggy, so it is recommended that you not install these unless you know you want them.

Once you've made your selections, you can click the ""Install"" button and allow Git to install itself. Continue to Gitlab Basics to learn more about how to use Gitlab."

https://support.cci.drexel.edu/getting-connected/discord/discord-bots/,Discord -- Bots,"Contact The CCI Helpdesk
Discord -- Bots
Bots are automatic users in Discord that you can identify by the BOT flag next to their username.

Why bots exist
Most bots are created with one of these purposes, or both:
To help moderate the server
To provide utilities to users
Moderator bots typically scan all messages for rule-breaking content, and if any is found, will delete those messages. They may also issue a warning to the sender, and/or alert the server moderators. It all depends on how the bot is configured.
Utility bots typically offer entertaining or useful services in the form of commands.
Bot Commands
Most bots offer commands for you to use. The specifics can vary, but typically, commands start with a ""/"". These are called slash commands.
Slash Commands
When you type /, you'll get a list of available slash commands, like this:

On the left, you'll see a list of every bot in that server that offers slash commands. In this case, there is only one. Below that is a slash icon, which represents default Discord commands.
The commands are sorted by bot, so you can click one to jump to it, or scroll through. Note that the dividers are small and easy to miss if you're scrolling quickly.

You can click a command to put it in your message box, type it out yourself, or use tab to autocomplete the first suggestion based on what you already have typed.
Irregular Commands
Some bots were made before Discord introduced slash commands, and haven't been updated to the new system, so they use their own command systems.
To find out what commands they have available, you'll have to use their help interface. Many bots will include the help command in their status message on the server list, like this:

If there isn't one there, try ""!help"", "".help"", and ""?help"", as they are typical help commands. If none of those work, the bot might not have a help command, or it might be esoteric, so ask someone who knows the bot."

Discord -- Emotes, Gifs, and Stickers
Emotes
Most Discord emotes are emoji, but there are other emotes too. They can be used in messages, to react to messages, or in status messages.
Emote Selector
On the far right side of the message bar is an emote icon. The exact emote shown will vary, because every time you hover over it, it changes to a random face emote.

Clicking the emote icon will bring up the emote selector. Clicking an emote in the selector will paste it into your message
At the top of the emote selector is a search bar for emotes. Some emotes have alternate names that can also be searched for. For example, searching man_in_business_suit_levitating will give you the levitate emote.

Next to the search bar is a 👏 icon which will bring up a skin color menu.

Most hand (such as 👍), person (such as 👴), and body part (such as 👂) emotes will adjust to match the selected skin tone.
Below the search bar is the full list of emotes. These are sorted into collapsible categories.
First come frequently used emotes. The relative order of emotes in this list is based on how many times you've used them and how recently.
Below that are server-specific emotes, if applicable. Note that emotes from other servers you're in will also appear, but unless you have Discord Nitro, they will be grayed out and inaccessible.
Below that is the collection of all emotes, sorted by type.
There is also a sidebar on the left that will list all the categories for easy jumping.
Using emotes in messages directly
If you paste an emoji into Discord from another application, it will automatically convert into a Discord emote. To avoid this, escape it by putting a \ before it.
If you know the name of an emote, such as thumbsup, you can type it into your message directly by surrounding it with colons, such as :thumbsup:
You can also search for an emote by putting part of its name after a colon, like so:

Note that once you fully type an emote's name, it will automatically convert to the emote. This will not occur for the :tm: or :copyright: emotes, which will still appear as text. However, they will render properly once you send the message.
Reactions
When you hover over a message, one of the options in the menu that appears is to add a reaction.

Clicking this option will bring up the emote selector. Once you choose an emote, it will appear as a reaction underneath the message.

The blue means that you added this reaction, and the 1 represents the total number of people who added that reaction.
Clicking it again will remove your reaction. Clicking an emote that's not in blue will add your own reaction to it.
Hovering over the reaction will show you up to three people who gave that reaction.

If there are more than three, you can see the rest by going into the reaction menu, accessed through the ""..."" when you hover over the message.

Here, the reactions will be sorted by quantity, and you can click each one for a complete list of who gave it.

Emotes in status messages
When editing your status, emotes cannot be added mid-message. However, on the left, you can select an emote that will appear on the left of the message. This will bring up the emote picker.
For more information on status messages, please see the following:
Discord -- User Profile and Status
GIFs
GIF menu
The GIF menu can be accesses through the GIF button on the right of the message bar.

Discord's GIF search uses Tenor, an online GIF service. You can search GIFs at the top, or select from the categories below.

When you find a GIF, you can click it to post it in chat directly. Note that this will be as its own message. You can also click the star icon in the top-right corner to add it to your favorites.

Favorite GIFs
You can hover over any GIF on Discord, even if it's not from Discord's GIF search, to show the star icon in the top-right corner. Note that if the background is white, you won't be able to see it unless you hover over the star itself.

Once clicked, the star will fill in, and you'll be able to access the GIF from the favorites menu in the GIF search any time thereafter on that same device. If you want to remove a GIF from your favorites list, just click the star again.
Stickers
Stickers are like larger emotes or images. They can only be accessed if provided by a server or if you have Discord Nitro.
To view available stickers, click the sticker icon on the far right of the message bar.

All available stickers will show up here, and can be sent as a message by clicking on them. As with emotes, they will be grayed out if you do not have Nitro and they are from another server."

          Cannot Install Cisco VPN because Cisco VPN Already Installed
On rare occasions, someone will install Cisco VPN, and get an error message that Cisco VPN is already installed.


First, try the Cisco VPN application in your Applications. If your current Cisco VPN application still works, use that.
If your current Cisco VPN application does not work, and you cannot install another because you are told it is already installed, do the following:
In the ""Cisco"" folder in your ""Applications"" folder, open and run ""Uninstall Cisco AnyConnect.""



Follow the onscreen instructions.
If you are told Cisco AnyConnect successfully uninstalled...
Follow the Cisco AnyConnect installation instructions at the top of this webpage.
If you are told again that you cannot install because Cisco AnyConnect is still installed:
 Go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.
Or find ""Terminal"" in a Spotlight search by pressing the Command + Spacebar, or Cmd + Spacebar, or ⌘ + Spacebar keyboard keys simultaneously.
Type in the following command at the prompt:

sudo /opt/cisco/vpn/bin/vpn_uninstall.sh

Enter your Mac password.
Once the command finishes running:
Follow the Cisco AnyConnect installation instructions at the top of this webpage.
If that still doesn't work, contact ihelp@drexel.edu .
Problems using Java with VPN Connected
If you have problems using Java with VPN connected, you'll need to open the Java Control Panel's Security tab and configure it to allow the Drexel VPN. Here's how.
Open the Java Control Panel 

Windows 10 instructions: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/win_controlpanel.xml
Mac instructions: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_controlpanel.xml

See the following screenshot for how to set the control panel to allow Java access in a Drexel VPN session.


Why Not Use Self Service for Mac?
If you have Self Service for Mac installed (which all instructors and staff with Macs should), you can definitely install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN application from there easily while on-campus at Drexel.
However, off-campus users must first connect to the Drexel network using the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client to use Self Service for Mac to install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client. It's a classic paradox or catch-22.
To avoid that, the instructions below explain how to install the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client without using Self Service for Mac.
Note that the Cisco AnyConnect VPN client updates itself when it first connects.
Troubleshooting Tip
If the Cisco AnyConnect application doesn't work on a Mac (especially macOS X Mojave), run this command in terminal: 

sudo chmod 777 /private/tmp
Then close and re-open Cisco AnyConnect, and try again.
If it still does not work, try a reboot."

How to create Discord channels for courses
1. Click on the "" + "" next to the name of the category for your course






2. Select whether you would like a text or voice channel and add a name for the channel
*You do not need to turn on ""Private Channel"" because the channel should inherit the same access as the category. When the channel is created, there will be a lock on it to indicate it is ""private"" from the entire server










3. Check that the channel is private. If you see a lock on the "" # "" next to the channel name, that means the channel is not visible to the entire server, which is good. 
If you don't see the lock, or want to check permissions, right-click on the channel or click the small gear on the channel

If you right-click the channel, you can select ""Edit Channel"" to look at channel settings



4. Click on the ""Permissions"" tab. Generally, if the channel is marked as being synced with the category, your permissions should be defaulted to give access for you, TA's, and students to send and read messages



5. If there is an issue with the permissions or you want to change them, scroll to see ""Advanced Permissions"". You may need to click on the arrow to open the Advanced Permissions drop-down


@everyone - This is the permission that prevents the whole server from seeing your course channels. If "" View Channel"" is marked with the X, then your channel is hidden from students who aren't in your course, other faculty, and staff. Keep this permission off for @everyone

@{Course}-{Term}-Student - This is the role your students have. We recommend having ""View Channel"", ""Send Messages"", and ""Read Message History"" ON

@{Course}-{Term}-Staff - This staff role applies to all professors and TAs of the course
{Course} is the name of your course, eg CS260.
{Term} is the term your class is running in, for example FA22 or WI23.
5. Click ""Save Changes"" to save the new permissions for the channel. If you don't click this you will need to make new changes again

Git: Issue with Git Push (HTTP: Failed to Auth)
As quoted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15381198/remove-credentials-from-git
  The Git credential cache runs a daemon process which caches your credentials in memory and hands them out on demand. So killing your git-credential-cache--daemon process throws all these away and results in re-prompting you for your password if you continue to use this as the cache.helper option.
You could also disable use of the Git credential cache using git config --global --unset credential.helper. Then reset this, and you would continue to have the cached credentials available for other repositories (if any). You may also need to do git config --system --unset credential.helper if this has been set in the system configuration file (for example, Git for Windows 2).
On Windows you might be better off using the manager helper (git config --global credential.helper manager). This stores your credentials in the Windows credential store which has a Control Panel interface where you can delete or edit your stored credentials. With this store, your details are secured by your Windows login and can persist over multiple sessions. The manager helper included in Git for Windows 2.x has replaced the earlier wincred helper that was added in Git for Windows 1.8.1.1. A similar helper called winstore is also available online and was used with GitExtensions as it offers a more GUI driven interface. The manager helper offers the same GUI interface as winstore.

Microsoft Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA -- Change or Add MFA Method
Introduction
You can change the phone number for Drexel Office 365 Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA,
or add multiple phone numbers, or add email address, or add or switch to the Authenticator app.

You can even use the Authenticator app on a second phone or mobile device.

Below is how.
Quick Instructions
As long as you signed in somewhere where you don't have to approve MFA,
or you have a working primary or secondary method of MFA,
you don't need DU IT or Drexel accounts to add your new phone number for MFA.

Visit https://aka.ms/mfasetup to set up a new or additional methods of MFA, and get rid of ones that you don't want.
If you have issues logging in with MFA, or want to test your other MFA methods (which you should), note the small little blue ""Sign in another way"" link when you have to approve MFA. 
Try that when testing other MFA methods, or if your primary method of MFA does not work.
The information below shows you how to test this and do this in much more detail, if the above gives you issues.
You always want to test all MFA methods, especially new ones.
In-Depth Instructions
First, open a web browser,
preferably one you do not normally use
(if possible or without much difficulty).
Open a Private or Incognito or InPrivate Window or Tab,
and login to https://portal.office.com 

Once you confirm your existing method of MFA still works, which is VERY IMPORTANT,
close the web browser completely.

If your primary MFA method does not work,
click ""Sign in another way,""
and use one of your secondary MFA methods.

No second MFA method?
Call DU IT accounts at 215-895-2020,
and press 2 & 2 again at prompts.
They need to reset your MFA method.
And assist with setting up a 2nd MFA method as well.
Do not proceed further here in this scenario.

If your existing MFA method works for you,
proceed to step #3 below.

Open a normal & not private window/tab in your preferred web browser,
and login with Drexel userid & password to: 
https://aka.ms/mfasetup
and use your primary MFA method, if prompted.

With “Security info” selected in left navigation panel,
click ""+ Add method""
to add a different phone number,
or email,
or set-up an authenticator app, if you wish.

If an app, the Microsoft Authenticator app is recommended.

Leave this web browser open for now

Open a web browser that is NOT the one you normally use
(if possible or without much difficulty).
Open a Private or Incognito or InPrivate Window or Tab,
and login to https://portal.office.com 

When at the MFA approval step,
click ""Sign in another way,""
and use the secondary MFA methods you just set up.

This steps tests whether your secondary MFA method works.
Which is very important.

If the test fails, repeat all of the above steps again.

If the secondary MFA method works,
close this web browser completely again.

In your preferred web browser,
where you are logged into https://mysignins.microsoft.com ,
check for & remove any non-working MFA methods.
To do so,
click the ""Delete"" link to delete an existing phone number or MFA method.
Further Troubleshooting

Discord -- Server Navigation Bar
The server navigation bar lists the channels in the server. Each channel is a different space where conversations can take place.

Channel types
Text channels
Text channels are denoted with a # symbol, such as ""#general"".
When you click one, you see the message history of that channel, and can type your own messages for everyone else to see.
Voice channels
Voice channels are denoted with a 🔊 symbol, such as ""🔊General"".
When you click a voice channel, the main screen doesn't change, but you join the chat, and can communicate with anyone else in the chat using your speakers and microphone.
Everyone in the chat can be seen listed below the channel, like so:

To leave the voice chat, just push the phone icon with an X at the bottom of the navigation bar. This represents hanging up.

For more information, see the following:
Discord -- Voice chat
Private channels
If a channel has a lock over its symbol, that means it's a private channel. Only some members can see it, and this extends to any messages within. Note that if anyone gets access to the channel later, they will be able to see its full message history just like those who already have access.
If you can see the channel, that means you have access. While you are viewing a private channel, the user list on the right side of the screen will only show members who also have access to that channel.
Category
Many servers group their channels into categories. These are denoted with a ˅ symbol, such as ""˅ INFORMATION"".
Categories are not channels. They start expanded, but you can click to collapse them, or expand them again. Note that if the channel you have open is in a collapsed category, that channel will remain visible until you open a different channel.
Top menu
At the top of the navigation bar is the name of the server. Clicking it will bring up a menu, with these options:

Server boost
This feature requires Discord Nitro, which must be purchased. Clicking it will provide more information, which is mostly irrelevant for the CCI Discord server.
Notification settings
This will allow you to control how and when you receive notifications from the server. See the following for more information:
Discord Notifications
Privacy settings
This will allow you to toggle receiving direct messages from server members. See the following for more information:
Direct Messages in Discord
Hide muted channels
This will cause all muted channels to be invisible in the channel list. Any channel you currently have open will remain visible until you leave it. To make the channels visible again, just uncheck the option.
Leave server
This will remove your account from the server entirely. In order to rejoin, you will need an invitation again.
Bottom menu
At the bottom of the navigation bar is a menu showing your profile picture. For information on this menu, see the following:

SCP & SSH by Windows 10 PowerShell CLI Command Line Interface
Using the SSH CLI for Tux
A CLI is a Command Line Interface. No pictures, no graphics, just text. A CLI Command is what you would type at the command line prompt.
DO NOT ssh into Tux in the same window that you use the SCP command in! 
If you ssh into Tux, you won't be able to scp to/from your local computer (normally).
SSH CLI Commands below:
Command (use if you have issues with above):
ssh yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu
Example:
ssh mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu
Connect to remote Tux host.
A password prompt will then be displayed.
Please type in your password
Your password will remain invisible the whole time.
Once you type in your password, simply hit Enter or Return on your keyboard.

SCP Can Overwrite/Delete Files & Folders
If you scp a file to Tux or your computer,
and that file name already exists where you are copying it to,
the file you copy overwrites a file with the same name.
If you scp an entire folder to Tux or your computer,
and that folder name already exists where you are copying it to,
the folder you copy overwrites the folder with the same name.

So...
If a file or sub-folder existed in the folder you copied to,
but not in the folder you copied from,
the file or sub-folder gets deleted from the folder you copy to.
So... Back-Up Your Files, Folder, and Data!!
MAKE BACKUPS OR COPIES OF YOUR IMPORTANT FILES!!!
Google the cp command for Linux.
Frequently make copies of files and folders in a SEPARATE folder with a DIFFERENT NAME!!!!
Or use OneDrive. See Office 365 -- OneDrive.
Or Github or Gitlab or some other solution.
SCP Quick Tips
Examples are in next section below. This section provides quick tips.
SCP or Secure Copy Protocol lets you securely copy files or folders between two machines/computers/servers/hosts.
scp is the CLI command, or Command Line Interface command.
scp needs you to specify the source you are copying from & destination to copy to.
So...
scp source_file_or_folder destination_file_or_folder
Specify source (where you copy from) 1st & destination (where you copy to) 2nd.
Always refer to the machine you are *not on* with userid@host:/file/folder/path
Or for some, the old method of: userid@host:/file/folder/path
Always refer to the machine you are *on* with just /file/folder/path
Check file paths. Mistyped file paths are a very common error.
Do NOT ssh into Tux BEFORE you use scp!
For SCP, do NOT ssh into Tux to scp!
DO NOT use the ssh command at all in the same Terminal window when you use scp.
If you ssh into Tux, you won't be able to scp to/from your local computer.
Otherwise...
Your computer would need to be set up as a host on a network,
and you'd need to know the computer hostname,
and a userid that can login via the internet.
You know Tux's hostname and your own username on tux.
SCP PowerShell vs cmd.exe Tips
SCP (and SSH) can now be done in cmd.exe Command Prompt or Powershell.
But make sure OpenSSH client is installed in Windows.
To verify, go to Start menu > Settings > Apps > optional features > scroll down and look for OpenSSH.
This adds SSH functionality to Windows,
and the user can use SSH from the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell.
PowerShell is recommended over cmd.exe, and Windows Terminal over either.
cmd.exe has different commands than li. (Use dir for ls.)
We no longer recommend running either as Administrator.
scp and ssh work without Administrator access.
And...
You can't drag file icons into the cmd.exe or PowerShell window and get the full file path! ;-) ;-) ;-)
For SCP, Windows Terminal Works Too
Windows 11 users have Windows Terminal by default.
Windows 10 users can go to the Microsoft Store if they really want Windows Terminal.
Windows Terminal basically lets you use your choice of either cmd.exe or PowerShell or Linux commands.
The SCP commands covered here work for cmd.exe and PowerShell and Windows Terminal.
SCP Examples in cmd.exe/PowerShell/Windows Terminal
Below are example of how to use SCP. It's the same commands in PowerShell or Windows Terminal or cmd.exe (Windows command prompt).
For ALL of these examples:
Win10userID is your Windows 10 (or 11+) login userid.
""yourTuxUserid"" is your Tux userid.
Do not use mjg88 as either your Tux or Windows 10 (or 11+) userid.
mjg88 is an example for either userid.
pwd command prints outs (shows you) your current folder (working directory) and the full file or folder path of it
ls command lists the files or folders in the current folder (working directory)
cd /path/to/folder changes directory, or navigates to, a different directory or folder
cd sub_folder_name changes directory, or navigates to, a sub-directory or sub-folder of the current folder or directory you are in.
cd ../ changes to the parent directory or goes up one folder level
cd changes directory to your home directory or folder
Example 1
Command:
scp yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt ""C: \Users\Win10userID\OneDrive - Drexel University\Desktop""\
Command example:
scp mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt ""C: \Users\mjg88\OneDrive - Drexel University\Desktop""\
Copying the test.txt file from your remote Tux home folder to your local Windows PC computer's desktop folder.
Quotes needed around the Desktop folder path on your computer because of the spaces in the OneDrive folder name.
Also, need a backslash or \ AFTER the end quote at the end of the file path to indicate it's a folder.
If you use \"" , that escapes the quote and cmd.exe will think you need another line for the rest of the command. Press Ctrl + c to re-enter the command.
Example 2
Command:
scp yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt .

Command example:
scp mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt .
Copying a file named test.txt from your remote Tux home folder to your local Windows PC computer.
The period at the end indicates that the file will be copied to the current directory or folder you are in within cmd.exe or PowerShell.
Example 3
Command:
scp test.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt

Command example:
scp test.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt
Copying a file named test.txt from your local Windows PC to your remote Tux home directory.
You already navigated in cmd.exe or PowerShell to the folder (directory) on your local Windows PC that you want to copy the file from.
Example 4
Command:
scp C:\Users\Win10userID\Downloads\test.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt

Command example:
scp C:\Users\mjg88\Downloads\test.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt
Copying a file named test.txt from your local Windows PC's Downloads folder to your remote Tux home directory.
Example 5
Command:
scp yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt C:\Users\Win10userID\Downloads\

Command example:
scp mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt C:\Users\mjg88\Downloads\
Copy the file test.txt from the remote Tux host to your local Windows PC's Download folder
Example 6
Command:
scp C:\Users\Win10userID\Downloads\test.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:

Command example:
scp C:\Users\mjg88\Downloads\test.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:
Copy the file ""test.txt"" from your local Windows PC's Desktop folder to the remote Tux host
Note: If you forget the colon or : at the end, you will just create a file named ""yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu"" or ""mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu"" in whatever folder or directory you type this command in the cmd.exe or PowerShell.
Example 7
Command:
scp -r test_folder/ yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test_folder

Command example:
scp -r test_folder/ mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test_folder
Copy the folder ""test_folder"" (with a file inside) from your local Windows PC to the user's remote Tux host home directory
Example 8
Command:
scp -r test_folder/ yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test-folder-newname
Command example:
scp -r test_folder/ mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test-folder-newname
Copy the folder ""test_folder"" from your local Windows PC to the your remote Tux host home directory, and rename it as ""test-folder-newname"".
Example 9
Command:
scp -r ""C:\Users\Win10userID\Downloads\test folder""\ yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:/home/yourTuxUserid/

Command example:
scp -r ""C:\Users\mjg88\Downloads\test folder""\ mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:/home/mjg88/
Copy the folder ""test folder"" (space in the name) from your local Windows PC to your remote Tux host home directory.
Also, need a backslash or \ AFTER the end quote at the end of the file path to indicate it's a folder.
If you use \"" , that escapes the quote and cmd.exe will think you need another line for the rest of the command. Press Ctrl + c to re-enter the command.
Example 10
Command:
scp .\test_folder\test.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:

Command example:
scp .\test_folder\test.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:
Copy the file ""text.txt"" within the sub-folder or sub-directory ""test_folder"" from your local Windows PC to your remote Tux host home directory.
This copies only that file. Not the entire sub-folder or sub-directory.
We're not renaming the file. And we're placing it at the top of level of your remote Tux host home directory. So no need to specify a folder or sub folder or file name nor a path to a file, folder, or directory.
Example 11
Command:
scp test.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test-folder2\
Command example:
scp test.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test-folder2\
Copy the file ""test.txt"" from your local Windows PC to the sub-folder or sub-directory ""test-folder2"" to your remote Tux host home directory.
Example 12
The screenshot below shows a few examples where spaces are in the folder name and/or file name,
and how to write the scp command accordingly when that occurs.
You need a backslash or \ AFTER the end quote at the end of the file path to indicate it's a folder.
If you use \"" , that escapes the quote and cmd.exe will think you need another line for the rest of the command. Press Ctrl + c to re-enter the command.

SCP CLI Tips on Windows
To use SCP Command Line Interface (CLI) on a Windows device:
Search 'cmd' in the bottom left search bar.
Select 'Command Prompt'.
Do NOT click on 'Run as administrator' unless you have a reason to.
In the cmd, you can change folders or directories by typing 'cd', followed by the folder name or folder-file path, and then click on the 'Enter' or 'Return' key.
Example 1: cd folder_name
Example 2: cd system32
Also, note:
Use 'cd ../' or 'cd ..' to go up 1 folder level or 1 directory level.
Use 'cd ../..' to go up 2 folder levels or 2 directory levels.
2 example screenshots below.




Use 'dir' to displays a list of a directory's files and subdirectories.
The command displays the disk's volume label and serial number,
followed by a list of directories and files on the disk
(including filenames, date, and last modified).
See example screenshots ABOVE and BELOW.

Use 'cd Desktop' to change the directory to the computer's Desktop directory.

When moving files/folders, do NOT use 'mv'.
Use 'move {filename you want to move} '{Desired location to put the file}'


Want a quick way of getting a long and complicated file path (or folder path, or file name)?
Open up File Explorer.
Double-click through folders to navigate to the file or folder.
Drag the file or folder icon from the File Explorer window to the cmd.exe or PowerShell window.
The full file path or folder path should appear in the command prompt line.
Use Home or End buttons to navigate to the start or end of the line.
Typing over characters? Press Insert or Ins to get out of overwrite mode.
Do NOT run as Administrator. Or this will not work.
See https://youtu.be/prVHU1fLR20?t=198

You can easily open cmd.exe or PowerShell in the same folder that you are viewing in File Explorer.
Just type cmd or powershell in the folder path or address line in file explorer.
And press the Enter or Return key.
See https://youtu.be/prVHU1fLR20?t=186

Or look at your command prompt, or type in cd at your command prompt.
You'll get a line showing your current working folder or directory, similar to pwd in linux.

If you type part of a file or folder name, and press the Tab key on your keyboard,
your computer will try to finish the rest of it.
If there are more than one folder or file that starts like that, it will only print some of the letters.
Type in 1 or more, and press Tab again.
You won't be able to do this for files on Tux. Open a different Terminal window, ssh into Tux there, and cd and use pwd to get the file name, then copy/paste.


SCP CLI Common Errors and Troubleshooting
Mistyped or wrong file name or folder path
See #6 & #7 tips above for how to avoid this, but if you mistyped the file name or long folder path or directory path for the file or folder on Tux or your computer, the command will not work (or it will copy something else, or copy somewhere else.
/path/to/file/: No such file or directory
...or...
ssh could NOT resolve hostname c: Temporary failure in name resolution
...or...
usage: scp [-346ABCOpqRrsTv] [-c cipher] [-D sftp_server_path] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
                     [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program] source ... target
You probably ssh'd into Tux BEFORE you scp'd in the same cmd.exe or PowerShell window.
Your computer would need to have a hostname and be a host or server on the internet for that to work,
and you'd have to specify userid@hostname:/path/to/file/fileORfolder2copy for your own computer, not Tux.
TL;DR?
If your command prompt says:
userid@tux#:~$
You ssh'd into tux.
Type in:
exit
Then try your scp command again.
Do NOT ssh into Tux BEFORE you scp.
In case the above troubleshooting tip still wasn't clear. :-)
scp: error: unexpected filename:
But no filename is listed.
Sometimes, the . command (used to mean ""in the current folder) is listed as a file in a directory, and scp tries to copy it, but it's not a file. So you get this error. You can disregard this error."

Video Instructions
https://1513041.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Putty+SCP+or+PSCP+File+Transfer/0_a5c65q37
For TUX access, current Tux users would probably use their Drexel username@drexel.edu , and not just their Drexel username. For example, if your Drexel userid was mjg88, you would use mjg88@drexel.edu , and not just mjg88. But if you run into issues, then try using only the Drexel username (so only mjg88 in this example).

Connect to Tux from Windows - Remote Desktop (RDP)
Remote Desktop allows you to use a full, graphical interface to the Linux compute servers. This can be more convenient when you need to print or use graphical apps like Matlab and Maple.
To connect to Remote Desktop, you'll need to be on Drexel's network, be that a hardwired network jack in your dorm, a Drexel workstation in one of the labs, on DragonFly3 wireless, or connected to VPN if you're off-campus.
There are many apps which can be used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which Tux supports, but our instructions support Microsoft Remote Desktop.
Please note that Tux Remote Desktop sessions are closed 5 minutes after you disconnect. Please make sure to save often in case you lose connection to the servers unexpectedly.
Download the Microsoft Store version of Remote Desktop:

Once you save the connection, you can double-click the machine to connect:
You may be prompted that the connection can't be verified. This is an advanced feature which we aren't yet supporting with Tux, and can be safely dismissed. You may select ""Don't ask me for connections to this computer"" if you'd like.
Next, you'll have to enter your user information. Your username is your Drexel user id (eg abc123), and your password is your Drexel password.

Once you click ""Done"", your connection should open. If you mistyped your password, you'll be asked for it again. You can also disconnect and open a new connection to try again. If you had a previous connection open, you may see a screen saver. Press a key on the keyboard, and you'll be asked to enter your password. Do that and you should get back to your desktop.

SSH, or Secure SHell, is a way of connecting to the command-line interface of Tux. This is how most courses will expect you to interact with Tux, as it provides access to the full power of Linux and works from anywhere in the world and on network connections ranging from dial-up to FiOS. 
To connect to Tux from Windows, you'll have to install an SSH client. We support logins through PuTTY and the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal. Other terminal emulators are available and may be used, but are not supported by CCI IT.
Video Instructions

Built-In SSH Client (Windows 10 and newer)
The following instructions are for connecting to Tux from Windows using the built-in SSH through Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal.
Type ""cmd"" into the search bar to open the Command Prompt. PowerShell or Windows Terminal can be used as well.
Type the following command and press Enter (replace 'abc123' with your Drexel user id):
ssh abc123@tux.cs.drexel.edu
If it is your first time conncecting to Tux from the Windows built-in SSH client, you will be prompted to accept the host key.
Type ""yes"".
When you hit the Enter key, you will be asked to enter your Drexel password.  When you type your password, nothing will show up. This is expected behavior - just type the password in and hit Enter. 
PuTTY Written Instructions
Download PuTTY at https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html 
You probably want the 32-bit MSI. This will run on practically any Windows machine, and the 64-bit variant does not provide any improvements for most use cases.
Run the MSI installer and accept the default options. This will install PuTTY in your Start menu.
Open PuTTY. Under Host Name, enter tux.cs.drexel.edu and choose the SSH button. You can also type a name for this connection in the text box below ""Saved Sessions"" and click the ""Save"" button so you can load this connection later.

Click ""Open"" and an SSH session will be opened. The terminal will say ""login as:"", and you should enter your Drexel email address (eg abc123) at the prompt and hit the Enter key.

When you hit the Enter key, you will be asked to enter your Drexel password. When you type your password, nothing will show up. This is expected behavior - just type the password in and hit Enter.
That's it! Now you have access to Tux and can use it for your coding assignments."

Troubleshooting -- Windows 10 S Mode Preventing PuTTY Install
Getting an error like the screenshot below that says something like, ""For security and performance, Windows 10 in S mode runs Microsoft-verified apps.""

Win 10 S mode only lets you install apps listed in the Microsoft Store app or website.
There are various apps outside of the Microsoft Store you'll need to install for one or more of your classes here at Drexel.
So follow the instructions below to turn off S mode for Windows 10.
You won't be able to switch back, but your computer is still very secure. And you'll need to download apps from outside the Microsoft Store for classes at Drexel.

Mac GUI config for Oracle linux.ischool.drexel.edu
Before you begin...
Note that the first part of this article details installing a local SQL database. You probably don't need this, as it is already available through Drexel's servers, but if you do need it, or you want to play around with it, then follow these instructions. Otherwise, skip to ""Part 2 - Connecting to the database"".
Part 1 - Setting up a local database
Step 1: Register an Oracle account.
Go to https://www.oracle.com/ and create an account.
Step 2: Get VirtualBox
Oracle has no installer for Mac OSX, but it has installers for PC and Linux. Therefore, we need to install a Linux virtual machine first.
Download VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. You can choose the latest version for OS X hosts.
After downloading, install it like any other Mac applications.
Step 3: Get the VM file
Download the Oracle DB Developer VM from https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/databaseappdev-vm.html
Scroll down until you see the setup section. Go to step 2 to click the ""Oracle DB Developer VM"" to download.
You may be prompted to log in first. Use the email and password from step 1 to do so.
This VM file is quite big, ~6GB. It may take a long time to download, so it is better to start the download process on a browser with an integrated download manager, e.g. Firefox, if you have a slow connection or are frequently experiencing dropped connections.
Step 4: Install the VM
Start the VirtualBox from LaunchPad. From the VirtualBox Menu select File > Import Appliance. Then make it point to the VM file you just downloaded. This process may take 10+ minutes.
Step 5: Start the VM, Oracle database, and SQL developer
After the import is completed, start the VM by clicking the green start arrow. The VM will start, but it may take minutes for it to be fully loaded.
Once it finishes, you have 2 options to operate the database:
Manipulate the database with SQL Developer
Manipulate the database with command line in VirtualBox
1. Test installation success with SQL Developer.
Click the SQL Developer on the desktop. It may take a while to fully start.
In the SQL Developer, under the ""worksheet"" section, type the command select count(*) from hr.employees;
Then click start (the green triangle right above the worksheet) to run the command.
If you get 107, it means you have the database up and running.
2. Test installation success with VirtualBox command line.
When the Linux desktop is fully loaded, there will automatically be a command line window on the desktop. Otherwise, you could find it by clicking Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal to start the command line window (upper left corner of the desktop.)
Connect to the database by typing the command sqlplus
It will prompt you to enter username and password. The username will be SYS ad sysdba and the password will be oracle
Be aware that the screen will not give any visual indication that you are typing your password. Just keep typing and make sure your input is correct, then hit enter.
Once it is connected to the database, you will see the ""SQL>"" prompt. Type the command select count(*) from hr.employees;
Hit enter. If you get 107, it means you have the database up and running.
Now let's get some information on service and instance names of the database. First, exit the SQL prompt by typing exit;
Then in the main prompt ($), type the following command to get the system listener status: lsnrctl status
Then you will see the service summary. Keep notes of the service names (such as ""cdbl"", ""cdblXDB"", ""orcl"") and instance name (such as ""cdbl"".) These names may be useful in the future.
The SQL developer inside VirtualBox is an internal client-end application of the server. Also, it is very slow to run, so it is better to install a SQL Developer on Mac OSX and connect it to the database in the virtual server.
Part 2 - Connecting to the database
Note: We (Bill Doran and the CCI Commons) do not support using 3rd party applications such as SQL Developer or Oracle Xpress to connect to CCI Oracle servers. If students have any issues w.r.t. connecting to the Drexel Oracle server, they must fallback to using the supported Oracle SQLPlus CLI on our Oracle server.
Instructions to do so can be found here: Oracle SQL -- linux.ischool.drexel.edu
Install SQL developer on Mac OSX
First, download the SQL developer from the following page. Scroll down to Mac OSX.
https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html
After downloading, un-zip the file. Then you will get an application file ready to be started on Mac OSX. You can drag it to the ""Application"" folder.
If you do not already have it, install JDK 8 from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
Then click the SQLDeveloper.app to start.
If you are using Big Sur and cannot launch SQLDeveloper successfully, follow these steps:
Open Finder -> Go -> Go to Folder...
Go to ~/.sqldeveloper/
Open 20.2.0/product.conf with a text editor of your choice
Find your Java Home by going to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
Add the following line to product.conf (line 22): SetJavaHome /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_281.jdk/Contents/Home
Restart SQLDeveloper
Click ""no"" if it prompts you to import preferences from a previous installation.
Connecting to a local database
If your VM isn't already running, start it up first so you can connect to the database.
Click the green + symbol in the upper right to build a new connection to the database in the virtual box. Type in the following:
Connection Name: Demo
Username: hr
Password: oracle
Service name: orcl
Leave everything else as default, then click ""test"". If the connection can be successfully built, then you will see ""success"" after the ""status"" at the bottom left corner. Then click ""connect"".
Then you will see the ""Demo"" connection under ""connections"". Also, a worksheet will be loaded. In the worksheet, type select count(*) from employees; and click the green triangle play button to start the query.
If you get 107, it means the connection is successfully built. Now you can operate the database from the SQL Developer of Mac OSX.
Connecting to CCI Oracle servers
First, please ensure you are connected to the Drexel VPN: https://support.cci.drexel.edu/getting-connected/vpn/
Click the green + symbol in the upper right to build a new connection to the database. When connecting to CCI Oracle Servers, please use the following information:
    Connection Name: oracle2.cci.drexel.edu
    Username: <your oracle username, but without adding @ike – for example: tty22, but not tty22@ike>
    Password: your oracle password
    Connection Type: Basic
    Role: default
    Hostname: oracle2.cci.drexel.edu
    Port: 1521
    SID: orcl (do not select or use “Service Name”)
    Also, do NOT check any of the following: “OS Authentication”, “Kerberos Authentication”, or “Proxy Connection”
Leave everything else as default, then click ""test"". If the connection can be successfully built, then you will see ""success"" after the ""status"" at the bottom left corner. Then click ""connect"".
If you get a ""java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException"", you need to downgrade jdbc.library.
Downgrading jdbc.library
Download ojdbc8.jar in 12.2.0.1 JDBC Driver: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/jdbc-ucp-122-downloads.html
Open Finder -> Go -> Go to Folder...
Go to /Applications/SQLDeveloper.app/Contents/Resources/sqldeveloper/jdbc/lib/
Replace ojdbc8.jar and restart SQL Developer.
If you see other errors after the downgrade, it is a cache issue. Go to ~/.sqldeveloper/ and remove system.20.2.0.175.1842 and tmp"

Tux Web Services
Tagged with: tux
The Tux ecosystem has several web services available, designed to meet different needs for academic coursework. Their general usage is explained below.
Public Services
(accessible from anywhere in the world)
Plain HTML and PHP:
Plain HTML sites with PHP can be served directly from the Tux web server, www.cs.drexel.edu (a new alias will be coming shortly with more CCI-inclusive naming). This is an Apache web server, which loads any information in your home directory under the public_html directory. This directory must be world readable and executable (eg 755 permissions) in order for the web server to serve the content from it. Also, your Tux home directory must be world executable (711 permissions) in order for the web server to have permission to see your public_html folder. To access these sites, navigate to https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~abc123, where abc123 is your Drexel username.

To run cgi-bin applications using PHP, place the appropriate files in public_html/cgi-bin. These can be accessed at https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~abc123/cgi-bin/, where abc123 is your Drexel username.

Private Services
(only available on campus or through VPN)
Databases
CCI hosts several databases. Currently, available options are MariaDB and MongoDB. Other database systems may be developed, depending on course requirements.

Currently, all database access must be granted on a per-user level, with dedicated login information. Professors may request access for their students at least two weeks before the start of the term in which they are needed, and individuals may request access for class projects with approval from their professor. Requests should be sent to ihelp@drexel.edu and include the subject line ""Request for database - course #"". Please indicate which database type you would like when requesting the database, and provide an indication as to when the database will no longer be needed. Typically, this will be assumed to be the end of the term.

Jupyterhub
Jupyterhub is provided as a way of running Jupyter notebooks. To use Jupyterhub, you must first log in to the Jupyterhub server over SSH - from Tux, you can just type ""ssh jupyterhub"" and you should connect automatically and be prompted for your Tux password. Once you've connected, you can access the web interface at https://jupyterhub.cci.drexel.edu and login with your Tux credentials. Within Jupyterhub, you can choose which notebook to open from your home directory.
Here you can find more detailed instructions on how to connect to Jupyterhub.

Node.js and Python app port numbers:
For Node and Python sites, a port number must be assigned to your app. To get a port number, visit https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bjb344/portman.php
Node.js
Node is available on node.cci.drexel.edu. Sites are managed through pm2, a production-grade Node.js server, which can track changes in files, automatically restart services, remain running when logged out, and provide centralized logs.

To start a Node application, log in via SSH to node.cci.drexel.edu (either through VPN or through Tux) and cd to the directory where your node application lives. Once there, you can run the command 
pm2 start <<app-name.js>>
You can append the option --watch to have pm2 monitor the file for changes, allowing you to edit your code on Tux and it should automatically reload when you save your changes. To see logs, run the command 
pm2 logs
To exit the log viewer, type ctrl-c.

When you're done with your project, please run the command 
pm2 stop <<app-name.js>>
to stop running your app.

Python apps/frameworks (uWSGI)
Python apps and frameworks with a uWSGI interface can be run on the uWSGI server, temporarily hosted at bvm48.cci.drexel.edu.
To create a uWSGI site, create a directory inside your public_html directory on Tux called ""uwsgi"". Inside of this directory, make an INI file like the following. Replace <<PORT>> with the port number you've been assigned by your professor, or gotten by visiting https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bjb344/portman.php.  Replace abc123 with your username, and project.py with the name of your main Python file.
[uwsgi]
http-socket = 10.246.250.148:<<PORT>>
chdir = /home/abc123/public_html/uwsgi/
wsgi-file = project.py
processes = 4
threads = 2
To access your site, you'll need to be connected to VPN. Then, visit http://bvm48.cci.drexel.edu:<<PORT>>, where <<PORT>> is the port you specified in the ini file you created above.

For more information, visit https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/WSGIquickstart.html. This includes instructions on making ini files for specific frameworks."

repl.it works with 50+ programming languages, including Python, C, C#, Node.js, Basic, Machine Assembly and more.
It also lets you write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript webpage code, and run it, and host it.
It's very easy to collaborate and share with it.
And it's free. Code is public, but generally unlisted public, though if you just use your own name, someone may be able to find your code, though a lot of code get a ""word salad"" name, making it harder to search for it.
repl.it also has built-in classroom and assignment functions.

NOTE: For TUX access, current Tux users would probably use their Drexel username@drexel.edu , and not just their Drexel username. For example, if your Drexel userid was mjg88, you would use mjg88@drexel.edu , and not just mjg88. But if you run into issues, then try using only the Drexel username (so only mjg88 in this example).
Written Instructions
Download and install Cyberduck at https://cyberduck.io

Open up the Cyberduck application


Click the ""Open Connection"" button in the top-left corner

Type in tux.cs.drexel.edu for server address


Select the SFTP protocol in the dropdown


Enter your Drexel username and password.
NOTE:
For TUX access,
Current Tux users would probably use their Drexel username@drexel.edu ,
and not just their Drexel username.
So in the screenshot below, the ""Username"" filed would say...
mjg88@drexel.edu
and not just...
mjg88
But if you run into issues,
then try using only the Drexel username (so only mjg88 in example below).


You now have access to your Tux via CyberDuck GUI
Additional Tips
From here, you can do actions like drag-and-drop onto your local desktop


Be careful dragging files to locations that have a file with the same name. Determine if you want to overwrite the file.


You can drag-and-drop from your local desktop to a directory on Tux as well


When you delete files on Tux, it is only removed from the Tux directory. Your local copy is still preserved.



Files can be edited right out of Tux. Right-click the file > Edit With > Select BBEdit


If you want to set the default editor to BBEdit. In the top-left corner, go to Cyberduck > Preferences... > In the pop-up, select Editor tab > Select dropdown and change to BBEdit."

Connect to Tux from iPad - Remote Desktop (RDP)
Remote Desktop allows you to use a full, graphical interface to the Linux compute servers. This can be more convenient when you need to print or use graphical apps like Matlab and Maple. 
To connect to Remote Desktop, you'll need to be on Drexel's network, be that a hardwired network jack in your dorm, a Drexel workstation in one of the labs, on DragonFly3 wireless, or connected to VPN if you're off-campus.
There are many apps which can be used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which Tux supports, but our instructions support Microsoft Remote Desktop.
Please note that Remote Desktop connections are closed 5 minutes after you disconnect. Save your work often in case you lose connection to the server unexpectedly.

Find the Microdot Remote Desktop app in the App Store.
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092?mt=8
Open the Remote Desktop app and click the + button, then choose ""Desktop"":


Type 'xtux.cci.drexel.edu' into the ""PC Name"" field and click 'Save'.


Once you save the connection, you can tap the machine to connect:
You may be prompted that the connection can't be verified. This is an advanced feature which we aren't yet supporting with Tux, and can be safely dismissed. You may select ""Don't ask me for connections to this computer"" if you'd like.
Next, you'll have to enter your user information. Your username is your Drexel user id (eg abc123), and your password is your Drexel password.

Once you click ""Done"", your connection should open. If you mistyped your password, you'll be asked for it again. You can also disconnect and open a new connection to try again. If you had a previous connection open, you may see a screen saver. Press a key on the keyboard, and you'll be asked to enter your password. Do that and you should get back to your desktop.

To disconnect from your session, press the hamburger menu button and choose ""End Session"". This menu also lets you put the interface in Touch mode (where you tap the things you want to select) or Pointer Mode (which lets you use the screen like a trackpad on a laptop).

The Keyboard button brings up the on-screen keyboard. If you have a hardware keyboard, you can ignore this sometimes, but there are also extra buttons which show up here. Pressing the ""123"" button gets you more special keys, function keys, and number keys.

Tux Account Information
All CCI Faculty and Staff, as well as all students enrolled in CCI classes, are eligible for access to Tux. 
Student access is typically available on the first day of the term in which they are enrolled for a course, and faculty and staff access is granted shortly after new members' account information is provided to CCI IT.
To log in to Tux, use your Drexel userid, such as ""abc123"" as your username. An example for SSH login for that user would be ""ssh abc123@tux.cs"".
To log in on Gitlab, please use the ""DrexelConnect"" login method.
When on campus, please connect to Dragonfly3 rather than DrexelGuest, as the guest network sometimes causes issues with Tux access.
Tux Services
A list of services provided by Tux can be found at Tux Services, and Web services hosted on Tux can be found at Tux Web Services.

Before you begin...
Note that the first part of this article details installing a local SQL database. You probably don't need this, as it is already available through Drexel's servers, but if you do need it, or you want to play around with it, then follow these instructions. Otherwise, skip to ""Part 2 - Connecting to the database"".
Part 1 - Setting up a local database
Step 1: Download Oracle 11g.
Download Oracle 11g from the following link. It may take a while (10-30 minutes). 
https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/xe-prior-releases.html
If you want to try the latest version, you can find it here:
https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle-database-software-downloads.html
Step 2: Start Oracle installation.
Extract both zip files into the same directory. Then open the folder “database”, and click on the “SetUp.exe”.
When prompted, enter your email, and uncheck “I wish to receive security updates via my Oracle support”.
Check “I wish to remain uninformed of critical security issues in my configuration”.
Leave the options as default, such as choosing “desktop class”.
In typical installation configuration, leave everything as default, and input your password (your choice).
It may pop up alert that your password is not consistent with Oracle standard password recommendations. You can just click “yes” and continue. Then it will check prerequisites of installation.
Then click “finish” to start the actual installation process.
It may take a few minutes to install. During the installation, there may be prompts to ask you to grant access to some features. You can check all options and click “allow access”.
Step 3: Test Oracle installation success.
Go to windows “start”, and in the input box, type in “cmd” to locate the command window. In command window, first type in the following to log on to the database: sqlplus / as sysdba
When you see “SQL>”, type in the following to start up the database: STARTUP;
It is possible that the database has already been started, then you can continue. Type in the following SQL query clause after the prompt SQL> to test connection to the example database: select count(*) from hr.employees;
If you see the result of “107” returned, then it means the database is up and running.
To shut down the database, at the SQL> Command Line prompt, enter the following command: SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
Note that this command may take a short while to complete. To exit the SQL> prompt mode and go back to the main command window, type in the following: exit
Step 4: Take note of service names.
There are some service and instance names we need to write down in order to use them in the future. To do this, in main prompt of command window (not SQL> prompt) we can type the following to get the system listener status: lsnrctl status;
Then scroll down the command window, and you will see a service summary. Keep notes of the service names, e.g. “orcl.drexel.edu” and “orclXDB.drexel.edu” and instance names, e.g. “orcl” in this particular case (the first service “CLRExtProc” has UNKOWN status, so we don’t keep note of it).
Part 2 - Connecting to the database
Note: We (Bill Doran and the CCI Commons) do not support using 3rd party applications such as SQL Developer or Oracle Xpress to connect to CCI Oracle servers. If students have any issues w.r.t. connecting to the Drexel Oracle server, they must fallback to using the supported Oracle SQLPlus CLI on our Oracle server.
Instructions to do so can be found here: Oracle SQL -- linux.ischool.drexel.edu
Install SQL Developer
Download SQL Developer from the following link:
https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html
And choose “Windows 64-bit with JDK 8 included.”
Un-zip the file you downloaded. Click the extracted folder, and start the “sqldeveloper.exe”.
When the SQL Developer GUI is fully loaded, you will see a start page in the middle. On the left there is a “Connections” with no sub nodes.
Right click on “Connections”->”New connection”.
Connecting to a local database
In the pop-up window, type in the following:
Connection Name: Your choice;
Username: hr
Password: hr
Service name: what you kept notes of when you typed “lsnrctl status” in the command window in step 4 (any one of them.)
Leave the rest options as default. Click “test”. If successful, you will see “success” after “status” at the bottom-left corner.
If your test is successful, you can skip the following numbered steps. If you encounter failure, for example “user is locked’, then you could try the following:
Go to the command window (main window not SQL> prompt)
Type in the following: alter user hr identified by hr account unlock;
Then the user “hr” is unlocked.
After you test the connection successfully, click “connect”, then a new connection under the “connections” is built. At the same time, a worksheet will be loaded after the start page. In the worksheet, you can type in the following SQL clause, and click the green start button to test: select count(*) from employees;
If the result 107 is returned, then the installation is successful.
Connecting to CCI Oracle servers
First, please ensure you are connected to the Drexel VPN: https://support.cci.drexel.edu/getting-connected/vpn/
Click the green + symbol in the upper right to build a new connection to the database. When connecting to CCI Oracle Servers, please use the following information:
    Connection Name: oracle2.cci.drexel.edu
    Username: <your oracle username, but without adding @ike – for example: tty22, but not tty22@ike>
    Password: your oracle password
    Connection Type: Basic
    Role: default
    Hostname: oracle2.cci.drexel.edu
    Port: 1521
    SID: orcl (do not select or use “Service Name”)
    Also, do NOT check any of the following: “OS Authentication”, “Kerberos Authentication”, or “Proxy Connection”
Leave everything else as default, then click ""test"". If the connection can be successfully built, then you will see ""success"" after the ""status"" at the bottom left corner. Then click ""connect""."

SSH (Secure SHell) is a command-line commonly used to connect to Tux. Most courses will expect you to interact with Tux, as it provides access to the full power of Linux and works from anywhere in the world and on network connections ranging from dial-up to FiOS. 
Starting in Spring 2023, Tux will allow you to log in with your Drexel credentials. Legacy Tux accounts are still being created, but should only be used to access Gitlab.
To connect to Tux from Mac and Linux, you don't need to install any software. Everything you need is integrated into the operating system.         
Find your terminal app - for Mac, this is in the ""Utilities"" folder in your ""Applications"" folder. For many Linux distributions, you can open a terminal with the keyboard shortcut control-alt-T.

 On a Mac, your Terminal app looks like this:

On a Linux, your Terminal app looks like this:

 Once you have your Terminal app open, type the command ""ssh"" followed by your Drexel email address and ""@tux.cs.drexel.edu"". Then, press the Enter key.

 For example, if your username is abc123, you would type: ""ssh abc123@tux.cs.drexel.edu"" and press Enter.

You will be prompted to enter your password. Note: nothing will show up when you type. Keep typing your password in normally and hit enter. "

Connect to Tux from Macintosh - Remote Desktop (RDP)
Remote Desktop allows you to use a full, graphical interface to the Linux compute servers. This can be more convenient when you need to print or use graphical apps like Matlab and Maple. 
To connect to Remote Desktop, you'll need to be on Drexel's network, be that a hardwired network jack in your dorm, a Drexel workstation in one of the labs, on DragonFly3 wireless, or connected to VPN if you're off-campus.
There are many apps which can be used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which Tux supports, but our instructions support Microsoft Remote Desktop.
Please note that Remote Desktop connections are closed 5 minutes after disconnect from the server. Make sure that you save your work often in case you lose connection unexpectedly.
Find the Microsoft Remote Desktop app in the App Store. 
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12

Once you save the connection, you can double-click the machine to connect:

You may be prompted that the connection can't be verified. This is an advanced feature which we aren't yet supporting with Tux, and can be safely dismissed. You may select ""Don't ask me for connections to this computer"" if you'd like.

Next, you'll have to enter your user information. Your username is your Drexel user id@tux.cs.drexel.edu, eg abc123@tux.cs.drexel.edu, and your password is your Drexel password.

Once you click ""Done"", your connection should open. If you mistyped your password, you'll be asked for it again. You can also disconnect and open a new connection to try again. If you had a previous connection open, you may see a screen saver. Press a key on the keyboard, and you'll be asked to enter your password. Do that and you should get back to your desktop.

Tux public_html Folder and Public Webpage Troubleshooting
Instructions
You can post public HTML pages on Tux by placing HTML and other related files in the public_html folder in your Tux home directory.
When you ssh into Tux, to see if you have a public_html folder, type in the following command, and then press the Enter/Return key.

ls
If you do not have a public_html folder, type in the following commands, and then press the Enter/Return key after each line.
cd
mkdir public_html
chmod 755 public_html
If you have a public_html folder:
Your HTML and other related files and sub-folders or sub-directories should be placed inside the public_html folder.
The index.html file within the public_html folder will be the main page or homepage of your CCI or CS website hosted on Tux.
To get to this website, navigate to https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~abc123/ in web browser, where abc123 is your Drexel username.
EXAMPLE: https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~mjg88/
Troubleshooting
Forbidden or 403 Forbidden
""You don't have permission to access this resources."" Or something similar.
The permissions on the public_html folder, or one or more files inside, may be incorrect.
Type in the following commands, and then press the Enter/Return key after each line.

cd
chmod -R 755 public_html

Try what's suggested in the ""Not Found or 404 Not Found"" section below as well.
Not Found or 404 Not Found
""The requested URL was not found on this server."" Or something similar.
Make sure you type in the web address or URL into your web address bar correctly.
Example: If you had a file called 2022.txt in your public_html folder, you'd go to:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~mjg88/2022.txt
Example 2: But index.html files do not need to be specified in the web address or URL.
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~mjg88/
Make sure you have a public_html folder, not publichtml or something that is similar, but not public_html. If the folder is not named public_html, rename the folder.
Example of how is below, where you have a publichtml folder.
Type in the following commands, and then press the Enter/Return key after each line.

cd
mv publichtml public_html

Sometimes, you just need to recreate the public_html folder.
Back it up first, in case you have files you need in it.
Then make sure the file permissions are correct.

Introduction
VMware vcenter is also known as VLAB. 
You use VMware vCenter if your instructor has requested that a virtual version of Linux or Windows is needed for lab or class work in a Drexel CCI course.
VMware vCenter vs VMware on ELMS/onthehub/e-Academy: You do NOT use VMware vCenter for licensed downloads and keys for Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, and even Windows 10 and possibly other Windows OS's that you can install on personal machines.
For more information about obtaining free copies for Drexel students, staff, faculty, and instructors for that software or OS, see Azure Dev Tools - Visio, Project, and Other Microsoft Downloads.
VMware vCenter is also NOT the place to download a copy of VMware to your computer. If that is needed instead, contact ihelp@drexel.edu .
IMPORTANT! Connect to Drexel VPN app off-campus. Do NOT access vcenter through https://vpn.drexel.edu.
Do NOT use the https://vpn.drexel.edu webpage to access https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu.
ONLY visit https://vpn.drexel.edu in order to DOWNLOAD the Drexel Cisco Any Connect VPN application.
Then INSTALL the Drexel Cisco Any Connect VPN APPLICATION.
Then CONNECT to the Drexel Cisco Any Connect VPN APPLICATION.
THEN visit https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu
Do NOT visit https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu from within the https://vpn.drexel.edu webpage.
You do not need to use the Drexel VPN on-campus.
But we also do not recommend using any non-Drexel VPN while accessing vcenter.
See VPN instructions for how to install and set-up the Drexel Cisco Any Connect VPN APPLICATION.
Instructions
Here is how to access your Virtual Machine (VM) using Drexel's VMware vCenter.
Navigate in your browser to https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu .
Off campus? Use the Drexel VPN before visiting above.
See VPN for how to connect to Drexel's VPN.
On the VMWare's ""Getting Started"" page,
click “Launch vSphere Client (HTML5).”


Login using your normal Drexel student id & password.
Use this format for your student id:
userid@drexel.edu


Once you have logged in,
you will see one of two screens.
(Covered in steps 5 & 6 below.)
If you see the screen below (blue),
contact ihelp@drexel.edu
& report that your VM is not available.

If you see the screen below (with lock),
your VM is available,
and you can continue.
Go to next step!


To get to your VM,
expand the navigation tree on the left:



Then click “Actions” > “Power” > ""Power On.”


“Powered On” will display on top of the small black VM desktop image.
Click the ""Powered On"" picture.
It will expand to a full interactive desktop in a new web browser tab.


For most users, select “Web Console.""

If you need to copy and paste into/out of the VM,
choose ""VMware Remote Console (VMRC).""
You'll need to ""INSTALL VMRC"" before 1st use of VMRC, though.
See Installing VMRC Install for Remote Console Option in VMware vCenter.

Also, hold off until you know which you truly prefer, but...
If you want, you can check ""Remember my choice,"" & click ""OK.""
(May not work in all browsers.)
Your VM will appear in a new tab. :-)

Tip #2
If you run into any issue at all,
also be sure to disable any ad blocking, or script blocking, or privacy enhancing add-ons or plug-ins for https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu .

An example of how to disable uBlock Origin is at the link below.
You might have AdBlock or NoScript or Ghostery
or some other ad blocker, script blocker, and/or privacy enhancer.

Example -- Set Up & Shut Down of Ubuntu Linux VM
Here is an example of how to boot up and shut down an Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine (VM),
once that VM is spun up in an internet browser tab.
Your instructor and lab assignment might not call for using Ubuntu Linux.

If so, follow your instructor's instructions instead.
Wait for Linux Ubuntu to boot up.


CT 210 students, click the ""Try Ubuntu"" button.
If your Instructor provides instructions to ""Install Ubuntu,""
click that button instead,
and follow the on-screen instructions,
and your instructor's instructions.


Do your lab assignment (if it calls for Ubuntu Linux).
When finished, click the gear icon in the upper right,
and click ""Shut Down...""


Click the large ""Shut Down"" button.


Press the Enter/Return key on the keyboard when prompted to finish the shut-down process.


When the Ubuntu Linux VM is fully ""powered down"" (black screen) in the web browser tab,
close the web browser tab.
Troubleshooting
General Tips
Using Chrome or Firefox is highly recommended.
We also recommend disabling any ad-blocking or script-blocking or privacy-enhancing add-ons or plug-ins for https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu .
Do NOT access vcenter.cci.drexel.edu through https://vpn.drexel.edu
Do NOT access vcenter by going through the webpage at https://vpn.drexel.edu
You should connect to the Drexel VPN through the Cisco AnyConnect app, which you download and install through the above webpage.
But AFTER you download and install the Cisco AnyConnect app and connect to vpn.drexel.edu IN THE CISCO ANYCONNECT APP, you do NOT go to https://vpn.drexel.edu any more.
You GO DIRECT to https://vcenter.cci.drexel.edu to access vcenter.
Below is BAD!

Non-Drexel VPN's on- or off-campus are NOT Recommended
We do not recommend non-Drexel VPN's to access vcenter, either on-campus or off-campus.
Cannot Login to vcenter.cci.drexel.edu?
Make sure you use your Drexel short-form email address, *not* just your DrexelOne userid.
Example of Someone's Drexel short-form email address: mjg88@drexel.edu
Example of that Same Drexel User's DrexelOne userid: mjg88
Do not use the DrexelOne userid.
Use the Drexel short-form email address.
pfSense Lab users? Cannot access pfSense in a Web Browser?
Do you have the pfSense VM from vcenter.cci.drexel.edu open and running and configured, per the instructions given to you by your instructor?
Try making sure you have both the pfSense VM and the Ubuntu or Trusty VM open and running in separate tabs in your web browser.
And follow what the instructions say carefully about setting up pfSense.
Some instructors have older instructions, or may have videos or instructions slightly out of order. Read ahead or look for videos from your instructor if confused.
Cannot Login to a VM, Especially a Trusty VM?
LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED TO YOU BY YOUR INSTRUCTOR!
They often provide an initial username and/or password to use.
For example: CT 400 for Trusty VM's often use usernames of either ""student"" or ""pfstudent"".
And use password of ""P@$$w0rd"". (But not always.)
Do NOT include quotation marks OR periods in the username OR password.
Be sure to change your password after your first successful login.
Google how to change your password on what OS you are on (Linux, Windows, Ubuntu, etc).
Not Sure How to Power Off Your VM?
See step 7 and 7a in the above ""Instructions"" section.
Installing VMRC for ""Remote Console"" option
The VMWare Remote Console will give you an experience more like a local virtualization platform.
And let you copy and paste into/out of the VM.
See Installing VMRC Install for Remote Console Option in VMware vCenter.
Cannot get to pfSense at 192.168.1.1 in your Trusty Ubuntu VM (if part of your lab)?
Make sure both pfSense VM & Trusty Ubuntu VM are running at the same time.
You need to have the pfSense VM running first
and to keep that VM up and running in one tab in your internet browser
while you visit 192.168.1.1 in the Trusty Ubuntu VM in another tab in your web browser.
Also, see the next section on no internet access in your Trusty Ubuntu VM.
Trouble Installing pfSense (if part of your lab)?
Try these webpages:
https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/install-pfsense.html
or...
https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Installing_pfSense
No Internet Access in Trusty Ubuntu VM?
First, make sure the pfSense router VM is powered on as well,
especially if you have already been using the pfSense router VM!
Second, if you have a metasploitable counterpart VM,
neither the metasploitable or other VM will have internet access by design.
With above in mind, try the following...
Click the WiFi icon in the upper right of your Trusty Ubuntu VM
when you have that web browser tab open, after logging into vcenter.
Make sure “Enable Networking” is checked.
If it’s not, select “Enable Networking” to check it or enable it.
If that doesn’t help,
check the WiFi icon again in the upper right of your Trusty Ubuntu VM again, and select “Wired Connection 1.”
And if that doesn’t help, make sure your computer (not either VM) is actually connected to the internet and that you can browse to some website you haven’t visited before, just to make sure your internet is working.
If that doesn’t help, shut down the Trusty Ubuntu VM, and close the tab, close the tab (if open) for pfSense, logout of vcenter, close all web browser windows, wait 20 seconds, and then re-open your web browser and try again.
If that doesn’t work, try Chrome instead of Firefox as your web browser for vcenter.cci.drexel.edu, or try Firefox instead of Chrome for vcenter.cci.drexel.edu.
If that doesn’t help, connect by VPN if you haven’t already (usually a really good idea for this).
If you login to the VPN, but the VPN keeps having a login error, you need to use your Drexel email or Office 365 Multi-Factor Authentication or MFA method to approve the connection on your cellphone, mobile device, or telephone.
My VM does not appear in the left navigation, after logging
Be sure to click to expand the left navigation options.


                         
pfSense VM boot looping (rebooting over and over again)?
If you get into a boot loop with pfSense:
When you see the screen to boot to multi or single user,
press the number for single user usually 2,
but look for single user,
and press the corresponding number.
OR press the spacebar.
At the command line prompt,
type in
cd /sbin
or
cd sbin/
Then type in
ls
and check that ""fsck"" appears somewhere in the outputted list of files, folders, and applications.
Then type in:
fsck -y /
Let the above fsck command finish running. 
Then re-run 2 more times.
Press the up keyboard arrow key,
and Enter/Return keyboard key.
Or re-type in the same fsck command as shown above.
The fsck command does a little more file system checking/repair each time.
Running it 3 times in total should do it.
Then type in reboot at the command line prompt. 
pfSense should reboot once now.
Final Important Step:
When you get to another list of options, do NOT choose ""1 Reboot (ssh only)"" or ""0) Logout (SSH only).
Do *NOT* press 0 or 1 either.
Instead, press ""6) Halt system"" (pfsense).
Then type y
And then give pfSense in the VM some time to shut down.
Disregard any ""An unrecoverable IOException occurred so the connection was closed"" errors.
When pfSense is shut down, close your internet browser tab.
When you re-open pfSense again (Actions > Power > Power On in vcenter.cci.drexel.edu web browser tab).
and get it configured as mentioned in the early labs for your tutorial,
You should not have to use the 6 or Halt command again.
You should just be able to leave the pfSense VM running,
and be able to close your web browser tab for the pfSense VM,
unless you run into an issue again.
pfSense vcenter VM Student and sudo Password
To access vcenter, you need to use your Drexel userid@drexel.edu with Drexel password, after connecting to the Drexel VPN (not via the Drexel vpn website either).
But if you are on your Ubuntu VM and trying to access the pfSense VM via the Terminal Console window (Command Line Inferface or CLI) & using the sudo command to install a package like NMAP, or simply trying login to the pfSense VM with the default Student account, try the default password of P@$$w0rd
If you changed the password from the default password, the password is going to be the same password you use to login to the Student account on the pfSense VM with.
If you are still not sure, but still have access to the pfSense VM,
you can try to guess it by installing a package via sudo, or try the sudo -l command as shown below.
Your password will not appear as you type it.
Make sure CAPS LOCK is off.
If you still cannot guess your password,
email ihelp@drexel.edu and let us know the course # and instructor and the assignment.

Troubleshooting Note for CCI Commons Student Assistants
CCI Commons Student Assistants and CO-OP:

Moving Files from Old Home Directory (Drexel migration)
On September 13, 2023, CCI IT migrated Tux authentication to Drexel credentials.
 As part of this transition, active users’ legacy home directories are being moved into their new Drexel-authentication home directories.
 When you log into Tux using your Drexel credentials, you’ll see a new folder called “old_homedir”. This contains the contents of your old home directory, with permissions changed so your Drexel account can access the files.
 To move files and folders from your old home directory into your new home directory, you can follow these steps:
-       From Tux, run the command “cd old_homedir”
-       Run the command “ls -al” to see what’s in the home directory
-       To move individual files and folders, run the command “mv {{file or directory name}} ..”
        o   This will place the file or folder in the root level of your new home directory.
-       To move all files from your old_homedir to your new home directory:
        o   First, move all regular files using the command “mv * ..”
        o   Then, if you have hidden files you want to transfer, run the command “mv .??* ..”. Make sure that you have the command correct, as this can cause issues if the “.??*”  isn’t copied correctly – that would move files in the parent directory.
-       Once you’re sure that everything has been moved from your old_homedir folder, you can delete it:
        o   Move to your home directory by running the command “cd ~”.
        o   Delete the old_homedir folder with the command “rm -rf old_homedir”.
                §  Once this is done, it cannot be undone. Make sure that you are ready to delete the old directory before you run this command, and make sure you type the command correctly to avoid accidentally deleting other files."

Connect to Tux from iPad - Remote Desktop (RDP)
Remote Desktop allows you to use a full, graphical interface to the Linux compute servers. This can be more convenient when you need to print or use graphical apps like Matlab and Maple. 
To connect to Remote Desktop, you'll need to be on Drexel's network, be that a hardwired network jack in your dorm, a Drexel workstation in one of the labs, on DragonFly3 wireless, or connected to VPN if you're off-campus.
There are many apps which can be used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which Tux supports, but our instructions support Microsoft Remote Desktop.
Please note that Remote Desktop connections are closed 5 minutes after you disconnect. Save your work often in case you lose connection to the server unexpectedly.

Find the Microdot Remote Desktop app in the App Store.
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092?mt=8
Open the Remote Desktop app and click the + button, then choose ""Desktop"":


Type 'xtux.cci.drexel.edu' into the ""PC Name"" field and click 'Save'.


Once you save the connection, you can tap the machine to connect:
You may be prompted that the connection can't be verified. This is an advanced feature which we aren't yet supporting with Tux, and can be safely dismissed. You may select ""Don't ask me for connections to this computer"" if you'd like.
Next, you'll have to enter your user information. Your username is your Drexel user id (eg abc123), and your password is your Drexel password.

Once you click ""Done"", your connection should open. If you mistyped your password, you'll be asked for it again. You can also disconnect and open a new connection to try again. If you had a previous connection open, you may see a screen saver. Press a key on the keyboard, and you'll be asked to enter your password. Do that and you should get back to your desktop.

To disconnect from your session, press the hamburger menu button and choose ""End Session"". This menu also lets you put the interface in Touch mode (where you tap the things you want to select) or Pointer Mode (which lets you use the screen like a trackpad on a laptop).

The Keyboard button brings up the on-screen keyboard. If you have a hardware keyboard, you can ignore this sometimes, but there are also extra buttons which show up here. Pressing the ""123"" button gets you more special keys, function keys, and number keys.

SCP & SSH by Mac Terminal CLI or Command Line Interface
Using the SSH CLI for Tux
A CLI is a Command Line Interface. No pictures, no graphics, just text. A CLI Command is what you would type at the command line prompt.
DO NOT ssh into Tux in the same window that you use the SCP command in! 
If you ssh into Tux, you won't be able to scp to/from your local computer (normally).
SSH CLI Commands below:
Command (use if you have issues with above):
ssh yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu
Example:
ssh mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu
Connect to remote Tux host.
A password prompt will then be displayed.
Please type in your password
Your password will remain invisible the whole time.
Once you type in your password, simply hit Enter or Return on your keyboard.

SCP Can Overwrite/Delete Files & Folders
If you scp a file to Tux or your computer,
and that file name already exists where you are copying it to,
the file you copy overwrites a file with the same name.
If you scp an entire folder to Tux or your computer,
and that folder name already exists where you are copying it to,
the folder you copy overwrites the folder with the same name.

So...
If a file or sub-folder existed in the folder you copied to,
but not in the folder you copied from,
the file or sub-folder gets deleted from the folder you copy to.
So... Back-Up Your Files, Folder, and Data!!
MAKE BACKUPS OR COPIES OF YOUR IMPORTANT FILES!!!
Google the cp command for Linux.
Frequently make copies of files and folders in a SEPARATE folder with a DIFFERENT NAME!!!!
Or use OneDrive. See Office 365 -- OneDrive.
Or Github or Gitlab or some other solution.
SCP Quick Tips
SCP or Secure Copy Protocol lets you securely copy files or folders between two machines/computers/servers/hosts.
scp is the CLI command, or Command Line Interface command.
scp needs you to specify the source you are copying from & destination to copy to.
So...
scp source_file_or_folder destination_file_or_folder
Specify source (where you copy from) 1st & destination (where you copy to) 2nd.
Always refer to the machine you are *not on* with userid@host:/file/folder/path
Or for some, the old method of: userid@host:/file/folder/path
Always refer to the machine you are *on* with just /file/folder/path
Check file paths. Mistyped file paths are a very common error.
Do NOT ssh into Tux BEFORE you use scp!
Do NOT ssh into Tux to scp!
DO NOT use the ssh command at all in the same Terminal window when you use scp.
If you ssh into Tux, you won't be able to scp to/from your local computer.
Otherwise...
Your computer would need to be set up as a host on a network,
and you'd need to know the computer hostname,
and a userid that can login via the internet.
You know Tux's hostname and your own username on tux.
Using SCP
Below are example of how to use SCP.
For ALL of these examples:
""MacUserID"" is your Mac login userid.
""yourTuxUserid"" is your Tux userid.
Do not use mjg88 as either your Tux or Mac login userid.
mjg88 is an example for either userid.
pwd command prints outs (shows you) your current folder (working directory) and the full file or folder path of it
ls command lists the files or folders in the current folder (working directory)
cd /path/to/folder changes directory, or navigates to, a different directory or folder
cd sub_folder_name changes directory, or navigates to, a sub-directory or sub-folder of the current folder or directory you are in.
cd ../ changes to the parent directory or goes up one folder level
cd changes directory to your home directory or folder
Example 1
Command:
scp yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt /Users/MacUserId/Desktop/

Command example:
scp mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt /Users/mjg88/Desktop/
Copying temp.txt from your remote Tux home folder to your local Mac computer's desktop folder.
Example 2
Command:
scp yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt

Command example:
scp mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt
Copying a file named temp.txt from your remote Tux home folder to your local Mac computer.
You already navigated in the Terminal CLI on your Mac to the folder (directory) that you want to copy the file to.
You are not renaming the file.
So you do not need to specify the destination file or file path.
Example 3
Command:
scp temp.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt

Command example:
scp temp.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt
Copying a file named temp.txt from your local Mac to your remote Tux home directory.
You already navigated in the Terminal CLI on your Mac to the folder (directory) that you want to copy the file from.
Example 4
Command:
scp /Users/MacUserId/Desktop/temp.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt

Command example:
scp /Users/mjg88/Desktop/temp.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:temp.txt
Copying a file named temp.txt from your local Mac's Desktop folder to your remote Tux home directory.
Example 5
Command:
scp yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt /Users/MacUserId/Desktop/

Command example:
scp mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test.txt /Users/mjg88/Desktop/
Copy the file test.txt from the remote Tux host to your local Mac's Desktop folder
Example 6
Command:
scp /Users/MacUserId/Desktop/test.txt yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:

Command example:
scp /Users/mjg88/Desktop/test.txt mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:
Copy the file ""test.txt"" from your local Mac's Desktop folder to the remote Tux host
Example 7
Command:
scp -r test_folder/ yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test_folder

Command example:
scp -r test_folder/ mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test_folder
Copy the folder ""test_folder"" from your local Mac to the user's remote Tux host home directory
Example 8
Command:
scp -r test_folder/ yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test-folder-newname

Command example:
scp -r test_folder/ mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:test-folder-newname
Copy the folder ""test_folder"" from your local Mac to the user's remote Tux host home directory, and rename it as ""test-folder-newname""
Example 9
Command:
scp -r ""test folder""/ yourTuxUserid@tux.cs.drexel.edu:""test folder""

Command example:
scp -r ""test folder""/ mjg88@tux.cs.drexel.edu:""test folder""

Copy the folder ""test folder"" (space in the name) from your local Mac to the user's remote Tux host home directory, and rename it as ""test folder newname""

SCP CLI Common Errors and Troubleshooting
Mistyped or wrong file name or folder path
If you mistyped the file name or long folder path or directory path for the file or folder on Tux or your computer, the command will not work (or it will copy something else, or copy somewhere else.
Type in the following to find the full path name of whatever folder or directory you are in in Tux or in your Mac Terminal window.
pwd
Stands for print working directory.
If you type part of a file or folder name, and press the Tab key on your keyboard,
your computer will try to finish the rest of it.
If there are more than one folder or file that starts like that, it will only print some of the letters.
Type in 1 or more, and press Tab again.
You won't be able to do this for files on Tux. Open a different Terminal window, ssh into Tux there, and cd and use pwd to get the file name, then copy/paste.
/path/to/file/: No such file or directory
...or...
no could NOT resolve hostname c: Temporary failure in name resolution
...or...
usage: scp [-346ABCOpqRrsTv] [-c cipher] [-D sftp_server_path] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
                     [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program] source ... target
You probably ssh'd into Tux BEFORE you scp'd in the same cmd.exe or PowerShell window.
Your computer would need to have a hostname and be a host or server on the internet for that to work,
and you'd have to specify userid@hostname:/path/to/file/fileORfolder2copy for your own computer, not Tux.
TL;DR?
If your command prompt says:
userid@tux#:~$
You ssh'd into tux.
Type in:
exit
Then try your scp command again.
Do NOT ssh into Tux BEFORE you scp.
In case the above troubleshooting tip still wasn't clear. :-)
scp: error: unexpected filename:
But no filename is listed.
Sometimes, the . command (used to mean ""in the current folder) is listed as a file in a directory, and scp tries to copy it, but it's not a file. So you get this error. You can disregard this error."

Tux Services
Tagged with: tux
ALSO see Tux Web Services
CCI maintains a compute environment to support class requirements. Typically referred to as Tux, this environment provides various services, which are described below.
Tux nodes
The primary way of working with Tux is to log in to one of the Tux nodes. These nodes, numbered tux2 through tux4 (tux1 is reserved for management and testing), are virtual machines with 60 GB of RAM and 30 CPU cores. The underlying hypervisor runs on AMD Epyc CPUs.
Tux supports logins over SSH or Remote Desktop. For more information on accessing your account and logging in, please visit the page Tux Account Information.
Shared storage
Tux storage lives on the college's CEPH cluster, which provides 150TB of shared storage, including Tux file storage and space for virtual machines in the college's virtualization environments. Each Tux user is allocated 4GB of storage, and more storage can be requested for approved use cases. To request more storage, please contact ihelp@drexel.edu and include your username, how much space you need, and what the storage will be used for.
Single log-in
Starting in Spring 2023, Tux is moving to Drexel authentication. This will simplify logins and password resets, as users will no longer have two separate accounts.
Legacy Tux accounts are separate from Drexel credentials, and more information on getting your account can be found at Tux Account Information. These accounts are still being created for new users in Spring 2023, but should only be used for Gitlab logins.
Gitlab
CCI hosts a Git server, accessible to all CCI students, faculty, and staff. There is a limit of 10 personal projects set by default, but users may request an increase by sending a message to ihelp@drexel.edu explaining the need for more projects.
Gitlab projects include an Issues board, which can be used for project management, planning, and task management. If the project is shared with multiple users, each user can contribute to the board. Custom labels and milestones can be set on a per-project basis. Gitlab projects also include a Wiki section for documentation. 
Float and Double
Float and Double are the college's shared GPU workstations, which are part of the Tux ecosystem. Each node has 32GB of RAM, 8 CPU cores (virtualized AMD Epyc cores), and an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU.  Students, faculty and staff are welcome to use these resources as needed, but please keep in mind that these are shared resources. If a process is found to be preventing others from using the system, we reserve the right to contact the user(s) who are running those processes and request that they be stopped so others can use the system.
Float and Double can be reached by SSH. Use the same instructions as connecting to Tux over SSH(Tux Account Information), but replace ""tux.cs.drexel.edu"" with ""float.cs.drexel.edu"" or ""double.cs.drexel.edu"". 
Web server
All CCI students, faculty, and staff have access to an Apache web server. Files are served from the folder ""public_html"" in your user folder on Tux, and the sites can be seen at https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~(your username). Permissions for this folder (and all subfolders) should be set to 755 (eg, chmod -R 755 public_html). This will allow all users to read the contents of the directory and all subfolders.
Web Services
More Web technologies available as part of the Tux ecosystem can be found at Tux Web Services."

Fix SSH host key error for Tux
Introduction
Mac Terminal or Putty or another SSH client or command-line SSH or SCP should be able to connect as normal to Tux. You will need to accept a new host key when connecting. If you have trouble accepting it the RSA key, or get an error about a key or RSA key, try the following.
Windows
In cmd.exe or Powershell, type in:
cd C:\Users\username\.ssh
Where username is your username on the computer you are using.
You can also click folders in File Explorer to get to above.
Open known_hosts file.
Inside the known_hosts file, you need to remove all lines that say tux.cs.drexel.edu, tux, or tux with a number after it. It might be all on *one* line, separated by commas. You can just delete the entire line.
Once you remove those and save the file, you will be able to connect and accept the new host keys.
Mac
Go to /Users/username/.ssh where username is your account name on your Mac. To go to the .ssh folder, once you are in /Users/username/ press Command + Shift + '>/.' key which will show the hidden folders on your Mac
Open the file 'known_hosts' in /Users/username/.ssh using textedit.
Remove any lines that say tux.cs.drexel.edu, tux, or tux with a number after them. Make sure that you remove the full line.
Save the file and try connecting again.
Accept a new host key when it prompts after entering password and username.
Linux
Run the command ssh-keygen -f ""/path/to/.ssh/known_hosts"" -R ""tux.cs.drexel.edu""

The path is often ~/.ssh/known_hosts, but may change depending on your system.
You may also need to remove ""tux"" and ""tuxN"", where N is a number from 1-5, depending on which machines you've connected to before.

Connect to Tux again.
Accept the new Host Key."

Tagged with: tux password help terminal
When learning to use Linux have you thought?
Why is the password not typing in the terminal?
The keyboard works, just not when I enter my Tux password?

For security reasons, Linux won't show you typing in your password with asterisks (***) or any visible confirmation. The password is being typed and pressing the 'Enter' key on your keyboard will send a response saying it was ""successful"" if typed correctly and ""unsuccessful"" if typed incorrectly. Passwords in Linux have 'echo off' implemented which does not show user input compared to 'echo on' when typing in your user id.

C:Windows/system32>ssh tux.cs.drexel.edu

What's the easiest way to hide users inputting their passwords?
Not displaying it! Someone looking at your screen can see the plaintext.

So, why not show asterisks (***) instead of plaintext?
Printing asterisks for each character entered requires extra commands. Also, for more advanced Linux users, a typed key can be equivalent to an application rather than a character."

Connecting to Tux from Windows - SSH
Tagged with: ssh tux
SSH, or Secure SHell, is a way of connecting to the command-line interface of Tux. This is how most courses will expect you to interact with Tux, as it provides access to the full power of Linux and works from anywhere in the world and on network connections ranging from dial-up to FiOS. 
To connect to Tux from Windows, you'll have to install an SSH client. We support logins through PuTTY and the Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal. Other terminal emulators are available and may be used, but are not supported by CCI IT.
Video Instructions
Connecting to Tux from Windows Using the Built-In SSH Client
Connecting to Tux from Windows Using the PuTTY Client
Alternate Video Option: PuTTY SSH Client Video Overview
Built-In SSH Client (Windows 10 and newer)
The following instructions are for connecting to Tux from Windows using the built-in SSH through Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal.
Type ""cmd"" into the search bar to open the Command Prompt. PowerShell or Windows Terminal can be used as well.
Type the following command and press Enter (replace 'abc123' with your Drexel user id):
ssh abc123@tux.cs.drexel.edu
If it is your first time conncecting to Tux from the Windows built-in SSH client, you will be prompted to accept the host key.
Type ""yes"".
When you hit the Enter key, you will be asked to enter your Drexel password.  When you type your password, nothing will show up. This is expected behavior - just type the password in and hit Enter. 
PuTTY Written Instructions
Download PuTTY at https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html 
You probably want the 32-bit MSI. This will run on practically any Windows machine, and the 64-bit variant does not provide any improvements for most use cases.
Run the MSI installer and accept the default options. This will install PuTTY in your Start menu.
Open PuTTY. Under Host Name, enter tux.cs.drexel.edu and choose the SSH button. You can also type a name for this connection in the text box below ""Saved Sessions"" and click the ""Save"" button so you can load this connection later.

Click ""Open"" and an SSH session will be opened. The terminal will say ""login as:"", and you should enter your Drexel email address (eg abc123) at the prompt and hit the Enter key.

When you hit the Enter key, you will be asked to enter your Drexel password. When you type your password, nothing will show up. This is expected behavior - just type the password in and hit Enter.
That's it! Now you have access to Tux and can use it for your coding assignments."

Fix SSH Hostkey error?
A while back now, linux.cci.drexel.edu was rebuilt and a new server was deployed. If you previously had an account on the old server, you could get error when connecting to the current server that the remote host identification has changed.  This can be ignored and the new fingerprint/id can for the current linux.cci.drexel.edu server can be saved
An example of the change in remote host identification error is shown below.

WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256…………………………………………………4
See Fix SSH host key error for Oracle SQL on linux.cci.drexel.edu
Customized ssh Commands/Hashes for Mac Users? Not Anymore. Probably.
Since linux.cci.drexel.edu was rebuilt with the latest CentOS and packages...
Mac users should no longer need to use the customized commands/hashes they had to use on the old server.  They should be able to ssh directly to the server now.
But just in case it ever comes up again.

The Oracle.com website wants a username or email and password to download stuff like the local sqlplus client. What do I do?
The Oracle website login, username, email you use, and password are all separate from Drexel and from your Oracle SQL on linux.cci.drexel.edu account and from your Drexel password.
So just go ahead and register for and create an Oracle account, but ONLY IF YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD FILES FROM ORACLE.
Oracle just wants everyone to make an account in order to download stuff.
NO DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL OF ORACLE is needed for Drexel CCI classes. Any assignment you see like this is almost always marked ""Optional"" in Bb Learn.
You might want to try and use SQL Developer, and that may be required, though."

Connect to Tux from Windows - Remote Desktop (RDP)
Remote Desktop allows you to use a full, graphical interface to the Linux compute servers. This can be more convenient when you need to print or use graphical apps like Matlab and Maple.
To connect to Remote Desktop, you'll need to be on Drexel's network, be that a hardwired network jack in your dorm, a Drexel workstation in one of the labs, on DragonFly3 wireless, or connected to VPN if you're off-campus.
There are many apps which can be used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which Tux supports, but our instructions support Microsoft Remote Desktop.
Please note that Tux Remote Desktop sessions are closed 5 minutes after you disconnect. Please make sure to save often in case you lose connection to the servers unexpectedly.
Download the Microsoft Store version of Remote Desktop:
https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ3PS
Open the Remote Desktop app and click the + button, then choose ""Desktop"":

Type 'xtux.cci.drexel.edu' into the ""PC Name"" field.
If you're on a device with a high resolution display, you may want to choose ""Show More"" and set a reduced screen resolution.

Once you save the connection, you can double-click the machine to connect:
You may be prompted that the connection can't be verified. This is an advanced feature which we aren't yet supporting with Tux, and can be safely dismissed. You may select ""Don't ask me for connections to this computer"" if you'd like.
Next, you'll have to enter your user information. Your username is your Drexel user id (eg abc123), and your password is your Drexel password.

Once you click ""Done"", your connection should open. If you mistyped your password, you'll be asked for it again. You can also disconnect and open a new connection to try again. If you had a previous connection open, you may see a screen saver. Press a key on the keyboard, and you'll be asked to enter your password. Do that and you should get back to your desktop.
To log out, go to the gear/power button at the top right and choose ""Log Out"". "

https://support.cci.drexel.edu/software-courses/cs-public-information/resin/resin-introduction/,Resin Introduction,"Contact The CCI Helpdesk
Resin Introduction
Resin requires a tux (tux.cs.drexel.edu) account in order to run java servlets.  If you do not have one, but are taking a CS class this term, please email ihelp@drexel.edu
If are not a CS student but one is still required, then you may request one by emailing ihelp@drexel.edu
 Getting Started
In order to allow resin to manipulate your files your home directory must be set to 755, if you are unfamiliar that lingo, a linux refresher might be in order
Kurt Schmidt has a good linux tutorial that may be found at: 1, 2, and 3
The output of ""ls -dal ~"" should start with ""drwxr-xr-x""
It can be modified with ""chmod 755 ~""
Since this gives everyone read and execute permissions you may wish to lockdown the remainder of your directory (especially your coursework, but not your public_html)
Create a ""resin/WEB-INF"" at the root of your home directory (~) and lock this down to 770 as it will contain coursework and perhaps passwords
Anatomy of your WEB-INF directory
tmp
A directory that resin needs in order to compile and operate
lib
A directory to place extra external jars that you wish to be included
classes
The location for the code
It would be wise to separate each distinct project into a separate sub-directory
Your PGBundle will go at the root of this directory
Format is key, single space, =, single space, value (no quotes)
resin-web.xml
The brains of the operation, more on this later
Permission Issues
In order for resin to do anything, it must be able to read, write, and execute everything in your web-inf directory
Read -> Read code
Write -> Compile
Execute -> Run the code
I would not recommend that you give your directory over the resin group as it can hurt collaboration with other students as files can only have one group
Instead you should give resin access to the directory via and ACL
DO NOT DO THIS AT THE ROOT OF YOUR HOME DIRECTORY, WHILE IT WILL WORK, RESIN CAN'T DESTROY WHAT IT CAN'T TOUCH
Will set up perms in your WEB-INF folder
Command to Set Resin User Perms
This will give the user resin permission to RWX any files in the subdirectories
This will carry over to all new files
'setfacl -d -R -m u:$USER:rwx,g:resin:rwx ~/resin/; setfacl -R -m u:$USER:rwx,g:resin:rwx ~/resin/'

Running your java servlet
Place your code in classes/SOME/OTHER/DIR
Run ""getfacl AFILE"" to make sure that resin has permissions for all files
If it doesn't have resin contained in the permissions, then you should rerun the setfacl command.
~/resin/WEB-INF/resin-web.xml
The web-app section will surround the rest of the code
resin-web.xml
<web-app xmlns=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"" version=""2.4""
         xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
         xsi:schemaLocation=""http:/java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd"">
......
</web-app>

servlet sections
Each servlet needs a name and somewhere to point the code
In the example below the code is located at classes/SOME/OTHER/DIR/SERVLET_MAIN.java
Servlet_MAIN.java will call the rest of the code
servlet formatting
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>NAME_OF_YOUR_SERVLET</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>SOME.OTHER.DIR.SERVLET_MAIN</servlet-class>
</servlet>

servlet-mapping sections
Each servlet needs to be mapped to a url so that the webserver can put that out there.
Each servlet mapping needs a name and a URL pattern.
servlet-mapping
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>NAME_OF_YOUR_SERVLET</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/WHAT_YOU_WOULD_LIKE_THE_URL_TO_BE</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

If I made a url-pattern ""/test"", then I would find the application on resin.cci.drexel.edu/~USER/test
Keep in mind, you can have multiple servlets and mappings in each file."

CS Public Information -- Automatic Response Email
Automatic email response can be used to automatically notify those attempting to contact you at your user@cs.drexel.edu email address that you are out of office for whatever the reason may be. There are a few simple steps to configure auto-response for your email account, and they involve manipulating files and executing commands while logged in to tux.cs.drexel.edu in your home directory. If you need assistance after following this guide, please reach out to ihelp@drexel.edu, and we'll be able to assist you further.
Configuring Automatic Response for Leaving Office
Initialize .vacation.db
The .vacation.db file is a small database that collects the email addresses of those who contact you, as well as the date they contacted you, while you're away. We need to initialize this file first.
After logging into (SSHing to) tux.cs.drexel.edu, while in your home directory, execute the following command:
vacation -i
You can verify that there is now a file named .vacation.db in your home directory by listing it:
ls -l ~/.vacation.db
Create your away message
Now that we have the database in place, we need to create the message that will be used to automatically respond to incoming mail. This file has to be a valid email file, including headers, not simply the body of the email. The sample below is a good starting point, with edits as necessary. Note the $SUBJECT. This gets replaced with the subject of the incoming email being responded to. It is advised to leave the subject of the sample below as-is, so the automated response will be included in the same email thread for clients like Gmail.
With your favorite editor, create your message in your home directory, in a file named .vacation.msg:
vim ~/.vacation.msg
Your message should look something line the following, always including the From: and Subject: lines, editing them (and the body of the email) as you see fit:

From: gmcfoo@cs.drexel.edu
Subject: Re:$SUBJECT
 This is an automated response.
  Hello,
 I am on Vacation from DATE to DATE and will not be reading email until I return.
If this is an urgent matter, please contact CONTACT.
I will respond to messages in the order they have been received after my return.
 Thank you,
NAME
Edit your .forward
The mail server checks the .forward file in your home directory to check where it should send email to as an alternate to placing it in your home directory's Maildir. You will want to back up your current .forward file (if you have one) before making edits to redirect your mail to the /usr/bin/vacation utility.
First, check to see if you have a .forward file:
ls -l ~/.forward
If this file does exist, it is important that you copy it to a backup file. We will use this when you're back in office to restore your previous configuration:
cp ~/.forward ~/.forward.bak
Now that your (potentially) existing .forward file is backed up, we can edit the the old one (or create one for the first time) using your favorite editor:
vim ~/.forward
The file should contain the following, with relevant edits for your email address. Note that gmcfoo should be replaced with your username, not with your full email address. The email address for gmcfoo would be gmcfoo@cs.drexel.edu, and the .forward file for gmcfoo would be as it is below:
\gmcfoo, ""|/usr/bin/vacation -r 0 gmcfoo""
This instructs incoming mail to be sent to your CS mail's inbox as well as sending it along to the vacation utility. Additional email addresses can be included here; this is a comma-separated list of forwarding destinations. If you previously used your .forward file, feel free to include those destinations in this file as well. The -r argument is the number of days to wait before sending an autoresponse to a sender who has already sent you a message and gotten an autoresponse sent back to them. The default, without this argument, is one week. An argument of 0 can be used, but this is potentially dangerous, as it can lead to an infinite mail response loop.
Test your setup
Sending yourself an email from an external account and verifying you receive an auto-response is enough to test that the utility is working for you. Once you verify it is working, it is advised you change the -r 0 argument provided in your .forward file to be -r 1 or some other value. Doing so will prevent you from potentially causing an infinite mail loop and spamming your inbox with auto-responses from another automated response address. While unlikely, it is still a risk. You are free to leave this value as -r 0, but know that you might come back to office with a mailbox full of auto-generated spam.
Upon verifying that your auto-response message works and making the change to only automatically respond to senders, at most, once daily, you've successfully configured your out-of-office, automated response.
Disabling your Automated Response
Checking the .vacation.db
When you're back in office, the .vacation.db can give you a short list of who contacted you and when they contacted you. Reading the database can be done with a simple command:
vacation -l
Restoring your .forward
Now that you're back in office, you can relocate your .forward file and restore any previously used configurations. Moving the auto-response .forward to a backup location will help speed the configuration process the next time you're going out-of-office and need to configure your automated response.
mv ~/.forward ~/.forward.away
If you have a previously used .forward file that you backed-up in the configuration of your automated response, you can restore it now:
cp ~/.forward.bak ~/.forward
Optionally, Removing Unused Files
At this point, you can feel free to remove your automated response .vacation.msg message, as well as the backup .forward.bak files. This is completely optional, and simply to remove unwanted clutter in your home directory. They take up negligible space and are hidden by default:
rm ~/.vacation.msg
rm ~/.forward.bak
Additional Information
Additional information concerning the automated response, as well as another set of instructions (in case you'd like another perspective), is available in the manual page for the vacation utility, accessible by the following:

Thunderbird and Owl with Office 365
Introduction
Office 365 email can be made to work with the Thunderbird open-source email client.
To do, you must install an add-on to Thunderbird called ExQuilla.
The ExQuilla add-on has a 30-day free trial period, and then costs around $11.25 per year per user.
That said, the developers of ExQuilla has serious doubts that ExQuilla will be compatible with the next major release of Thunderbird.
So end of life of ExQuilla may be coming soon.
If you need to purchase an ExQuilla license, see the following webpage.
https://exquilla.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030119011
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) may now work with ExQuilla yet (maybe in 2020). Try the Owl add-on if you run into issues. Instructions for Owl are below.

On a Mac, you may see the spinning pin wheel appear for up to 30 seconds every time Thunderbird syncs email with Office 365. Try changing your email sync schedule to 10-15 minutes as a work-around solution.
If you update Thunderbird, update the Exquilla add-on through Thunderbird to the latest stable release.
If the ""Microsoft Exchange EWS URL"" is marked as bad, check that you are using the correct URL from the instructions above. Do not change or add any letters, number, punctuation, or spaces.
In Windows 10, if a script busy pop-up window appears, check ""Don't show this again,"" and click ""Continue."" Then wait until Thunderbird says it is responding again.
If no folders appear in the left panel, even after Thunderbird is responding again, close and restart Thunderbird.
When installing Thunderbird for the first time, skip integration and adding accounts and adding new email screens.
If you get an ""Authentication Required"" box where something like ""undefined[drexeloneuserid]@drexel.edu"" (without quotes) appears in the ""User Name"" field:
Correct the ""User Name"" field to only include your Drexel email address that includes your DrexelOne userid in it.
   (a) Do not included ""undefined"".
Enter your DrexelOne password.
Important: check the ""Use Password Manager to remember this password"" checkbox.
Click ""OK.""
Click ""Get Messages."" Wait for that to finish.
Then close and re-open Thunderbird.
If you get an ""Unable to Load Address Book File"" message each time you open Thunderbird, just click ""OK."" We do not currently have a solution for this issue and hope future updates to the Exquilla add-on will fix this.
General Troubleshooting Tips:
Make sure no characters (letters/numbers/punctuation) or white spaces (spaces created by our spacebar or tab key) are in the Search or Filter text boxes.
If the issue persists, try closing Thunderbird, (possibly rebooting your computer,) waiting 20 seconds, and opening Thunderbird again.
If the issue persists, try a folder repair on your new Drexel Office365 email account in Thunderbird.
https://www.lifewire.com/repair-folders-thunderbird-1173102
Do *not* repair multiple folders
If the issue persists, delete the new Drexel Office 365 email account you just added to Thunderbird.
You can add it back later. No emails will be lost by this.
To delete an account, click Tools menu > Account Settings > Account Actions > Remove Account. Check “Remove message data.” “Remove account information” should be checked. Click “Remove.” Wait for removal to occur. Click “OK” to close window.
Go to https://outlook.office.com in a web browser, login, click “More” in the left navigation panel if you do not see the “Deleted Items” folder in the left navigation panel, ctrl-click or right-click the “Deleted Items” folder in the left navigation panel, click “Delete All,” and click “OK.""
Then ctrl-click or right-click the “Junk Email” folder, click “Delete All,” and click “OK.""
You can recover “Deleted Items” for 30 days, if need be.
Re-add your Drexel Office 365 email account to Thunderbird.

Troubleshooting and FAQ's for MFA
What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
This is where you login, and then get a phone call, and press #.
Or login, then get a text message, and get a number to enter.
Or login, then go to an app, and get a number to enter.
Or login, then tap “Approve” in an app notification.
In other words, you have to use more than one factor/method to login/authenticate (prove that you are you).
Why is MFA needed?
Passwords by themselves are not enough anymore due to phishing, social engineering, fraud, overly simple passwords, black market password lists for sale on the dark web, and more
So a 2nd or additional way to show that you are who say you are when you login is needed.
Travel Outside the US - Use the Microsoft Authenticator MFA App & Set-up a Phone/Text MFA Method
Microsoft's Authenticator App works over internet, and it will work over WiFi in most foreign countries, unless there's some censorship blocking going on. 
BUT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, & SET-UP IN THE APP WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES.
Some countries (China, for example) may make installing the app from the Google Play or Apple App Store very difficult, due to its internet censorship restrictions.
AND visit https://aka.ms/mfasetup here in the US on a couple of the devices you are bring with you, and be sure you check the 60 days approval checkbox after login when approving MFA on each device. This is in case you need to change your MFA method.
AND set-up a 2nd or 3rd MFA method that involves a phone call or text message. That way, if the worse case scenario happens, you can visit https://aka.ms/mfasetup , change your primary method to a phone call or text message, and have a good chance of resolving your MFA issue
Be sure to see the suggested troubleshooting section below.
No Approve or Deny Notice from the Microsoft Authenticator App
Unlock (by fingerprint, Face ID, passcode, or PIN) your cellphone.
Open the Microsoft Authenticator app. Wait 5-10 seconds.
Mobile VPN's, mobile security features, mobile power saving features, and mobile data saving features can all block background processes that allow the notification app to appear with the app being open and at the forefront of your phone.
Ensure you have internet connection through your mobile internet network or by WiFi.
If that does not work, visit https://aka.ms/mfasetup , and if you need to login and use MFA, click ""try another way"" or ""sign in another way."" 
MFA is Not Working for Me - Troubleshooting Guide
If you are using the Microsoft Authenticator app:
If you use the app, be sure to unlock your phone and open the app and wait 10 seconds. Sometimes, especially if you use a VPN or data saver or power saver options, the app needs to be open and at the forefront of your mobile device.
Open the app and make sure you see a entry for ""Drexel University"" that has your short form Drexel email address listed, and directly underneath your short form email address should be a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds. If you do not see that, then further set-up of the app is required.
If are using Drexel's VPN:
Note that the VPN will say login error/failed until MFA is approved, and you only can use your primary MFA method (default authenticator).
If you use the app, be sure to unlock your phone and open the app and wait 10 seconds. Sometimes, especially if you use a VPN or data saver or power saver options, the app needs to be open and at the forefront of your mobile device.
If you are still having issues, call 215-895-2480 or stop by the CCI Commons Lab in room 1067 on the 10th floor of 3675 Market, and ask for help.
If you have already done reached out to the CCI Commons Lab, and our CCI Commons Lab student assistants have already gone through the above steps, call 215-895-2020. You may have an issue with your Drexel Account.
What if the Microsoft Authenticator MFA app keeps crashing?
Uninstall/reinstall it, but first, make sure you have a back-up method of MFA, like a phone call or text message to your cellphone, if only so that you can get your preferred Authenticator app installed.
If you have the Authenticator app set-up on 2 or more devices, remove both MFA methods at https://aka.ms/mfasetup , but only after going to that link and setting up a back-up method of MFA, like a phone call or text message to your cellphone.
Remember that most of the time you are prompted for MFA, there will be a sign in another way or try another way link, where you can use your 2nd or 3rd MFA method (and this is why it's important to have a 2nd or 3rd MFA method)."

Not recommended unless they truly need to edit the file,
and you trust them not to delete.
Hit back arrow in pop-up window.
Copy link or send email with link to share.
Other person has to click the link in order to actually get access.
NOTES
Do *NOT* use the email function within OneDrive
UNLESS (1) it is OKAY for everyone getting the email to see one another's email addresses and/or names
and
(2) everyone getting the email has a Drexel account.
Do not use the email function within OneDrive for non-Drexel people.
Use the share with anyone option, and copy/paste the link to the email instead into your Outlook or other email application.
Also, do not use the email function within OneDrive
unless you are 100% positive it is okay for everyone getting the email to see one another's email addresses and names.
If you are not 100% positive, copy/paste the link to the email into a new email in your Outlook or other email application.
In-Depth Instructions
Here is how to share one or more files and folders through OneDrive using the Share button.
Login to the Office 365 web portal at https://portal.office.com .
Click the ""OneDrive"", or cloud icon, in left navigation panel.
Select just 1 file or folder that you want to share.
Your files and folders will likely have different names.

The ""Share"" and ""Get link"" icons disappear if
multiple files or folders are selected.

Click the ""Share"" icon.

Click ""People you specify can edit/view""

Choose who should have access and if they can edit. Here are the Options.
""Anyone with the link""
Anyone with the link can view the contents of the file or folder.
You can also allow editing (check the box), set an expiration date for access, and set a password.
Click ""Apply"" to apply changes.

""People in Drexel University with the link""
Anyone with the link, and with a DrexelOne or DrexelConnect account, can view the contents of the file or folder.
Check ""Allow editing"" to allow editing.
Click ""Apply"" to apply changes.

""People with existing access""
You can add or remove the ability for those with access to edit the file or folder.

Resend the email to these people

""Specific people""
You will select specific people who can view the contents of the file or folder.
Check ""Allow editing"" to allow editing.
Click ""Apply"" to apply changes.

Click ""Apply"" to apply whatever sharing and access level you specified.
If you chose ""Anyone with the link,"" do NOT click the ""Send"" button.
Click the ""Copy link"" button, and copy/paste the link into a new email. And bcc all recipients.
You can control who sees the link and provide better instructions and a description of the link if you compose the email.
Everyone will see who gets the link if you click the ""Send"" button.
If you chose ""Specific People"", enter their email address(es). Then click ""Send.""
We do NOT AT ALL recommend this option for file sharing with anyone outside of Drexel. Too many people get confused about creating Microsoft accounts if they do not have one, or which email to share to access their account, or there sometimes are technical issues caused by their own organization's rules regarding what can be shared with their Microsoft account. You can use this option with specific Drexel students, staff, instructors, and faculty.

UTM - Sharing a Folder with a Linux Guest
Like many other virtualization solutions, UTM allows you to share a folder on your computer with a virtual machine running inside UTM. The following instructions are for Linux, and may be adaptable to Windows guests, but that has not been tested.

First, when you launch UTM, go to the VM you'd like to share files with. In the configuration details at the bottom, you will see a line called ""Shared Folders"". Click here and choose ""Browse"" to select a folder you want to share with the guest. In the dialog that comes up, select the folder you'd like to share. This could be your desktop, or a folder you create specifically for this VM. The VM will only be able to access the contents of this folder.

Next, start the VM. Once logged in, open a file window, such as your home directory. In Ubuntu, you can navigate to the ""Other Locations"" tab on the left, and should be presented with a few options for network storage.

Here, we want to select ""Spice Client Folder"". This is where UTM shares files with the guest. If you get the following error, give the system a few minutes and try again - it takes some time after starting the VM for the share to become available.

Once the VM and host are ready, you should see a new folder appear with an eject icon next to it. This is your shared folder from UTM.

Open this folder and you should see the contents from your host machine. Now you can share files back and forth with your VM!"

It is recommended to get Drexel’s ODR involved,
if this is for an event that where special accommodations are specifically required.
Or if you have a student with an AVR letter in a class in which you are using Zoom,
and the letter states needs related to lectures and lecture recordings pertinent to Zoom
Email disability@drexel.edu

https://drexel.edu/disability-resources/about/overview/
You should likely also email zoomadmin@drexel.edu ,
if this is for an event that where special accommodations are required
Meeting host or participants can control font-size and multi-spotlight pinning,
or people using pinning on their own.
And Zoom has a number of built-in accessibility features.
See above Zoom link.
Zoom automated live captioning is good,
but it’s our understanding that it’s not ADA-compliant,
or at least you need a transcriptionist to create a final transcript or caption for any audio or video recording.
It’s safest to have a human live transcriptionist or captioner,
if at all possible and if needed for the situations mentioned above.
Regardless, you'll need the blessing of Drexel’s disability@drexel.edu and/or zoomadmin@drexel.edu
to just use the auto-captioning for the automated live captioning feature in Zoom.
But you definitely need disability@drexel.edu and zoomadmin@drexel.edu
to definitely answer questions about live captioning or live transcribing,
or obtaining services for that.
You definitely need a human transcriptionist or captioner involved in providing transcriptions or captions for recordings. Again, disability@drexel.edu can often help with that,
if for a student with an AVL letter or for an event where accommodations are specifically required.
Drexel disability@drexel.edu may be able to help with human-made transcribing or human-made captioning. They may be able to pay for a 3rd-party service, or that’s my understanding.
Human-made transcribing or human-made captioning is not something any of the Drexel CCI full-time tech staff can do,
nor can any of the Drexel CCI tech support student assistants.
Nor can we create textual descriptions of images, scenes, graphs, etc.
There is a way to have a paid professional captioning service either have someone live caption,
or provide an automated captioning for live streaming.

Save using PDF Optimizer (Acrobat Pro)
PDF Optimizer provides many settings for reducing the size of PDF files. Some of the PDF Optimizer settings are comparable to the settings that are available when you create a PDF file using Distiller. Whether you use all of these settings or only a few depends on how you intend to use the files and on the essential properties a file must have.
In most cases, the default settings are appropriate for maximum efficiency—saving space by removing embedded fonts, compressing images, and removing items from the file that are no longer needed. Before you optimize a file, it’s a good idea to audit the file’s space usage. The space audit results may give you ideas about where best to reduce file size. You can also reduce the size of your PDF by using the Reduce File Size command.
Optimize a PDF (Acrobat Pro)
Open a PDF in Acrobat DC.
Choose File > Reduce File Size or Compress PDF.
Choose the location to save the file and click Save. Acrobat DC displays a message showing the successful reduction in PDF size.

Note: You have may have a watermark on the PDF after using the free version. 
The most effective method to reduce the size of files in PDF-XChange Editor is to use the Save as Optimized feature:

Click Save as Optimized. The Optimize PDF dialog box will open.
Ensure all check boxes are selected for data considered non-essential in terms of quality and change the compression format to bicubic for all image formats:

Click OK.
*This will leave a watermark on your PDF if using the free version*
If the file size is still too large then reduce the values in the dpi text boxes and/or change the values in the Quality dropdown menus and try again. Note: Image quality will be impacted when these values are reduced.

Gradescope
Gradescope is something Drexel CCI officially supports.

There is now integration of Gradescope into Bb Learn. We can assist with that if you email ihelp@drexel.edu .
So you create assignments in Gradescope, upload a list of students and their email addressed, which you can get from the “Work Offline” > “Download” functions in Bb Learn.

You can opt for students to be invited. They get an email, click a link in an email, and register. Then they have access to your course in Gradescope. 
You might want to run through “Manage a Course Roster” and “Create an online assignment” at the webpages below, or any other videos you wish. Both links actually go to the same webpage.

If you need flowcharts or UML or other diagramming tools similar to Microsoft Visio (especially if you are on a Mac), or a collaborative whiteboard tool, some of these tools may work great for you.
Diagrams.net (formerly draw.io)
a great Visio alternative
Good option for ERD's or Entity Relationships Diagrams!!!

AdobeXD -- AdobeXD Starter (free)
SEE SEPARATE SECTION FOR THIS BELOW!!!

Miro.com (our instructions page)
Excellent and easy-to-use white board & diagramming collaborative tool, free
Good option for ERD's or Entity Relationships Diagrams!!!
Below is an ERD template for Miro.com

Lucid Visual Collaboration Suite - Lucid Charts
another great Visio for Mac option

Bitpaper.io
Similar to Miro, but no free calling feature and only 1 paper per month (as of 4/15/2022).
There is also:
Figma: https://www.figma.com/
Penpot: https://penpot.app/

See ABOVE section's Diagrams.net for ERD's.

Or Miro.com in above section for ERD's.
For Miro.com, also see this free ERD template.

Zoom Whiteboard but Above Options Likely Better
Optional, but Zoom does have its whiteboard feature, and we'll link to info about that below.
ALSO, optional, but also note: you can also use the ABOVE tools while screen sharing if you need to collaborate. 
Or without screen share, and just use Zoom to talk or chat with one another in real time, if wanted.
Zoom -- Whiteboard, 2nd Webcam, and Writing
Balsamiq
In addition to this list of designing software applications...
Balsamiq's Wireframe for Desktop ...
is great because you are able to open local (.bmpr) files saved on your computer and cloud projects from their own integrated cloud.
The only downside (in comparison to other free software) is that there is only a 30-day trial, then you will need to buy a license to edit your work.
Although, viewing the extension file (BMPR) remains free regardless.
License is a one-time purchase, which is something to note if you would like the benefit of having a dedicated cloud.
https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/
Adobe XD Starter
It took me a while to fully test this, as it's crazy busy, and I didn't want to say it worked before I confirmed I could still use Adobe XD on the starter plan after the 7-day free trial.
But it the Adobe XD Starter plan does work after the 7-day free trial. And this actually what Adobe says to do for students and teachers trying to teach Adobe XD.
Go to the following link & click Download XD:
https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/pricing/starter-plan.html
Run the installer. It will install Adobe Creative Cloud.
If you do not have an Adobe account, you'll need to make one.
I'd recommend using your Drexel userid@drexel.edu email address,
but NOT your Drexel password.
Do NOT sign up for a paid plan.
Do NOT click buttons for any paid plans.
You ONLY want to do the Free Trial.
After Adobe XD installs, close Creative Cloud. You cannot uninstall Creative Cloud and still use Adobe XD, but you probably don't want to open Creative Cloud again (unless you use it for other purposes you know of). The Creative Cloud icon (looks like sideways 8 or infinity sign) may hang out near the date/time, but just let it. Close Creative Cloud if you accidentally open it, as best you can.
Going forward...
Always open Adobe XD from your Start or Windows menu (Windows 10/11).
Or open Adobe XD from Applications in Finder, Spotlight Search, Launchpad (Mac).
Every time you open the Adobe XD, you'll be asked to sign up for a plan. Do NOT sign up for a plan. Just click the X. If you accidentally click something else, just close whatever opens, or close Adobe XD and start again.
Notes for Adobe XD Starter
After 7 days, it will say your free trial has ended, but you can still just close that pop-up window, and use Adobe XD .
Do not try to uninstall or reinstall Adobe XD after the free trial period had ended. We have no idea if it will work still.
If you accidentally open from Adobe Creative Cloud, you may see a message that this is the last time you can open Adobe XD. It's not. But avoid opening Adobe XD from Adobe Creative Cloud.
Do not uninstall either Adobe XD or Adobe Creative Cloud.
It's on you if you accidentally or on-purpose sign up for the paid plan. You'll need to contact Adobe to work out cancellations and refunds. If you want someone to verify you are on the free trial and not a paid plan, send us a screenshot of what you see when you first open up Adobe XD."

Drexel Email Forwarding
Not for Professional Staff or Faculty
All Drexel students, staff, and instructors have been migrated to Microsoft Office 365 email, which has 50 GBs of storage.
So the days of students and adjunct instructors not being able to receive email because they have reached their storage capacity or quota on their email account are over.
But students can still forward their Drexel email to an outside email service, like Google's Gmail. This webpage explains how.
Note: No one, not even students, can forward their Drexel email to an outside email service through the Drexel Computer Accounts Management webpage at https://acounts.drexel.edu , or by creating rule/filter in Outlook.

     6. Enter the email address for the outside web service.
      
     7. If you wish, check the ""Keep a copy of forwarded messages"" box.
          (a) This will make sure that a copy of the emails sent to your Drexel email address will remain in your Drexel email account.
           
     8. Click the ""Save"" disk icon to save your changes.
      
     9. Click ""Options"" in the upper left to return to your email in Outlook.
      
     10. If you wish to sign out, click your name in the upper right, and then click ""Sign out.""
      

Another Method for Forwarding

Troubleshooting
Cannot Click Anything Using Edge in Windows
If you run into the issue where you cannot click anything when using Edge in Windows or everything seems small, the following seems to work.
Modify your Display Resolution to 1920 x 1080 with 150% (or 100%). See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-display-settings-in-windows-37f0e05e-98a9-474c-317a-e85422daa8bb#WindowsVersion=Windows_10
Make sure the Zoom level in your Edge browser is 100%. See https://www.howtogeek.com/658739/how-to-set-a-default-zoom-level-in-microsoft-edge/
When you run a report, install if prompted to install.
If you are told you need to install something, or something is missing,
click OK, and click to install what is missing or needed.
There are prompts to follow onscreen usually.
If this happens, it may take 5 minute, or it can take 30 minutes to 1 hour, but it usually installs what is needed.

Bb Learn -- Ally for Accessibility
Tagged with: Access accessibility Ally
Ally is currently something we specifically have to turn on for each Bb Learn course section.
What Ally does:
Ally provides alternative formats for much Bb Learn content in content areas (the areas with “Build Content” and “Assessment” and “Tools” and “Partner Content” buttons).
And Ally automatically reviews all files (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, etc) for how well the meet Accessibility guidelines, providing a “speedometer” icon. If the icon shows a red and slow speed, the document has Accessibility issues. If the icon shows green and a fast speed, it meets or largely meets Accessibility guidelines. And there are levels it can assign between.
If you click the speedometer icon, you get told what the accessibility issues are succinctly, and get tips how to resolve them. 
A person has to manually resolve these accessibility issues. Office and Adobe provide Accessibility review wizards that also greatly assist resolving such issues with these document types. 
Auto-generated captions, transcripts, and descriptions always require a human to review if ADA accessibility guidelines are to be met, but they can be used to assist in meeting those guidelines.
There is an overall Accessibility Report under Course Tools under the Control in the left nav in Bb Learn course sections where Ally is turned on.
Ally can convert some PDF’s with clear images of typeface text to selectable and screen-reader readable text, but there’s a lot to be desired at times with that feature.
Advantages for Using Ally:
Ally helps identify where there are accessibility issues and suggests how to resolve them
Ally can provide alternative formats to content in Bb Learn (often not attached files).
Alternative files and content that meets accessibility requirements (especially transcripts and closed captioning) often assists all users, as pedagogical recommendations are to provide alternative methods for accessing or engaging with content.
Some PDF files can be converted from images of clear typeface text to selectable and screen-reader readable text.
Ally will review the following file types for accessibility:
PDF files
Microsoft® Word files
Microsoft® PowerPoint® files
OpenOffice/LibreOffice files
Uploaded HTML files
Image files (JPG, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
We’ve see Ally review and rate plain text files too, but we think Ally always gives them a high or perfect rating, at least with a .txt file suffix.

How to create a SharePoint site via Teams
Tagged with: sharepoint teams
Instructions
After opening the Teams application, select the 'Teams' icon on the left-hand sidebar.
Next, select the 'Join or create a team' button on the bottom of the Teams bar.
Using the 'Join or create a team' page, select 'Create Team' on the main page. 
A pop-up will appear requesting the name of your team 
Optional: Add a description below the 'Name' field
The 'Privacy' field is recommended to be left as 'Private' for the team owner to have access control.
Click 'Next' when finished with the previous steps. 
A new pop-up will show a window to 'Select a team type'.
Select the 'Staff' option. 
A new pop-up will show a window to 'Add people to [Team Name]'.
Optional: Add members to the Team.
This step can be skipped by clicking the 'Skip' button. 
In the new Teams 'General' section, select the three dots on the top right-hand corner.
In the options, click 'Open in SharePoint' 
Once SharePoint opens, a pop-up to 'Start designing your site' will appear.
Click the 'Maybe Later' button or browse templates. 
After designing your site/skipping templates to browse, your SharePoint site is now created. 

We would recommend using a Team in Teams due to SharePoint being a less team-oriented service. If you feel more comfortable using SharePoint or the website's generation tools with built-in functionality, it is one of Microsoft's lesser updated services.
How to access the Sharepoint site later:
 Go to the website www.office.com in any browser.
Once signed in, select the 9 dots in the top left-hand side of the webpage.
Select the 'SharePoint' application under Apps.
Within SharePoint, select the site associated with your Team. 
 Now you are able to access your Team's SharePoint!"
https://support.cci.drexel.edu/software-courses/oracle-virtualbox/,Oracle VirtualBox,"Contact The CCI Helpdesk
Oracle VirtualBox
Oracle's VirtualBox is open source and free software that many, many other IT professionals and programmers use constantly if they need to run a Windows or Linux OS on a Mac laptop or desktop, or a different Windows OS on a Windows 10 laptop or desktop, or a even Windows 10 configured differently on a Windows 10 laptop or desktop. An operating system run within another operating system is a Virtual Machine (or VM). That's not the official definition, but it's a good one to use here. You can have multiple VM's on one machine, but you need a fairly powerful machine to run more than 1 VM simultaneously. The vast majority, especially the ones who are not systems administrators or maintaining servers, rarely need more than one VM at a time anyway.
This is a great, free, and open source alternative to VMware or Parallels.
Also, anyone at Drexel can get a Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Educational license at Azure Dev Tools. Instructions for that are included in the instructions below.
Instructions
Be prepared to devote 30 minutes or up to 2 hours to get this working the first time.
Download and install VirtualBox from the following webpage.
https://www.virtualbox.org/
You'll need a .iso file to actually run a particular VM.
Visit Azure Dev Tools to download a .iso
Instructions on accessing OS's form Azure Dev Tools is at the webpage below.
Azure Dev Tools - Visio, Project, and Other Microsoft Downloads
Or grab a Linux .iso from the website that maintains it. For example, Ubuntu Linux's download webpage is at https://ubuntu.com/download
Open VirtualBox.
Click ""New.""
Type in a ""Name"" (like ""Windows 10 VM"" or ""Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS VM"" or what you will) for your VM.
Choose a folder store for your VM.
Recommend storing it with your .iso file in a new folder you create (may have to do this outside VirtualBox in Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows)) called something like ""VirtualBox VMs"" or what you will.
For ""Type,"" choose the OS (Windows, Linux, etc - You cannot legally use a macOS or Mac OS on a Windows computer).
For ""Version,"" choose Windows 10, or Windows 7, or Ubuntu, or what the version of the OS is that you are installing.
You almost certainly are using a 64-bit computer, but use the following websites if you are not positive.
Windows 10: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-32-64-bit-faq (expand section on ""How can I tell if my computer is running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows"").
Mac: Choose apple icon in upper left → About this Mac
Click ""Continue.""
For ""Memory Size"", start with recommended sizes, and click ""Continue"" or ""Create.""
This can be adjusted later (but only if the VM is shut off).
For ""Hard Disk,"" let VirtualBox ""Create a virtual hard disk now,"" by choosing that option, and clicking ""Create.""
Use ""VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image),"" and click ""Create"" or ""Continue.""
Let the ""Storage on physical hard drive"" be set to ""Dynamically allocated,"" and click ""Continue.""
Do not modify settings for ""File location and size,"" and click ""Create.""
Double-click the VM in the left navigation panel in VirtualBox.
In the window that opens, find and select the .iso files.
The VM window may be small. If so, find the ""View"" menu, and choose ""Scaled Mode,"" and select ""Switch.""
Then pull on the corners of the VM window to make it fit.
You can close the little reminder windows at the top of your VM (like the one on ""mouse pointer integration"").
Follow the on-screen instructions in the VM windows to install your Windows or Linux or other VM.
You'll need to make your own choices here. There are too many OS's and options to guide you. :-)
But it's hard to screw up too badly, as long as you choose your own language.
That said, for Windows 10 users, you usually want to choose a local account when you install Win 10 as a VM for the first time.
And your VM may restart to apply updates to the virtual OS.
For Windows, if you have a Drexel account, try logging in with your Drexel ""Work"" Microsoft account or Office 365 account credentials (userid email and password).
If that does not work, try the local account option.
In the smaller text, there should be a link to this option.
If you run into an issue, look for a ""Skip"" button or link or option. 
We do NOT recommend turning ""Cortana"" on in Windows 10. It's additional resources that may not work anyway in your VM.
(THIS OPTION FOR PERSONAL OR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY.) Once your VM is booted up and you are logged in, and if you are using Windows, click the ""Devices"" menu in VirtualBox, and click ""Insert Guest Additions CD"". Then open ""File Explorer,"" go to ""This PC,"" enter the ""CD Drive,"" and open and install the ""VBoxWindowsAdditions"" application. Use all of the default options, and install what they say to install. Then choose the option to ""Reboot Now"" when prompted to ""Reboot.""
Linux (at least Ubuntu Linux) has a Guest Additions option too. See the following pages for Linux. Not all flavors of Linux covered.

Workaround for pygame on arm-based MacBook
Tagged with: m1 pygame python3 macOS mac laptop
Python programs referencing pygame terminate with an error when being run in Thonny on Macs with arm processors (M-family of chips). 
A workaround is to execute python files using the Terminal app on your Mac instead of running it through Thonny. Follow the steps below to run your .py file using a Terminal:
Press Cmd+Space Bar on your Mac and search for the 'Terminal"" app. Terminal opens up in your User folder by default
Navigate to the folder with the .py file to be executed with pygame (the folder where you saved the file using Thonny)
Ensure the file has executable permissions using ""chmod +x <filename.py>""
Execute the file using the command ""python3 <filename.py>""
Please feel free to contact your course TA/instructor or email ihelp@drexel.edu for further assistance."

Apple Mail -- Send Email, Not Read Email
On the off chance you want to be able to send email from Apple Mail, but you do not want to read any email at all in Apple Mail, here is how to set this up using Drexel's Office 365 (or another email).
Basically, we're going to set up Apple Mail as you normally would to read and send email using your Drexel Office 365 email (or another email account).
But we're going to then set Apple Mail to *NOT* show you your email messages, or show or sound any notifications when you receive email. (In other words, out of sight, out of mind.  )
This will also ensure that if you click a ""mailto"" link in a webpage (hyperlink that opens up your default email client), Apple Mail will open up so that you can send your email, but you will not be able to read any email.
     1. Make sure ""Apple Mail"" is set to be your default email client on your Mac.
          (a) Visit the webpage below for instructions.
               i. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201607
          (b) Then return to this webpage.
     2. Follow the instructions at the ""Apple Mail"" on a Mac computer or laptop section at the webpage below.
          (a) Apple Mail Set-Up

     4. At the top of the screen, click ""View,"" then select ""Hide Favorites Bar.""
     
     5. At the top of the screen, click ""View,"" then select ""Hide Mailbox List.""
     
     6. At the top of the screen, click ""View,"" then select ""Preferences.""
     
     7. On the ""General"" tab, for ""New messages sound,"" select ""None.""
     
     8. On the ""General"" tab, for ""New message notifications,"" select ""VIPs.""
     
     9. On the ""Viewing"" tab, for ""List Preview,"" select ""None.""
          (a) Click the small circled red ""x"" to close the Viewing/General/Preferences pop-up window.
          
     10. Send an email to yourself (either your Drexel or a non-Drexel email) account, and check your Drexel or non-Drexel email account to make sure it arrives.
          (a) You'll briefly see the email in the left panel before it gets sent out.
          (b) It may take up to 5 minutes for the email to arrive at its destination, though usually not that long.

Some applications, like Sophos Safeguard may have some more files after opening it. Click on the application file inside the expanded file.
Sophos Safeguard DE:

Sophos Safeguard FS:

If you updated to Big Sur or Catalina and get notices:
You will need to allow the app, by going to the ""Apple Icon"" (Top left of screen)

From here, you can click on the apps to manually open apps and set permissions (Check on this...)
Conclusion:
When performing the instructions, you will not need to use the Launchpad app on the apple machine because this will not give you the access to the shortcuts.

Creating Microsoft Forms, Including Import and Timer Use
Creating Forms
Introduction
If you need a quick form, we HIGHLY recommend Microsoft Forms though https://forms.office.com.
NOTE: Be sure to work with a CCI faculty or staff member if you are collecting data from people for ANY sort of research or class work. They can guide you to proper procedures and protocols. We just cover technical aspects of Microsoft Forms for the most part here.
You can quickly create forms with https://forms.office.com.
IMPORTANT quick tip for Microsoft Forms! 
Create the form from the Web Excel at https://portal.office.com (look for Excel logo in left nav, after login), if you want your responses in a Excel spreadsheet format where you can view LIVE results. 
Otherwise, you always have to download a copy of the results in Excel format. There may be advantages to not having anyone tamper with LIVE result data too, of course. 
You can freely experiment with creating a form 1st in Forms, and then 1st in Excel.
Instructions
You can create forms with https://forms.office.com , and it is pretty straightforward. 
But if you want to create the forms with  https://portal.office.com.
Look for Excel logo in left nav, after login.
(You'll login with your Drexel userid@drexel.edu and Drexel password),
and then select the New blank Workbook Option.

Azure Dev Tools for Teaching or Education - Visio, Project, and Other Microsoft Downloads
Introduction
Licensed downloads and keys for Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, and even Windows 10 and possibly other Windows OS's that you can install on personal machines, can be obtained by all Drexel Faculty, Staff and Students at the following link:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/developer-tools/
Microsoft Project does NOT work on Macbooks or macOS or iPads or iOS.
Microsoft Visio also does NOT work on Macbooks or macOS or iPads or iOS.
Visio for Mac
There is no such as as Visio for Mac. Microsoft makes Visio, but they don't make it for Mac. You will need to use an alternative app or program.
There are lots of alternative apps or programs for Mac that do diagramming and flowcharts and UML as well.
So if you just need flowcharts or UML or other diagramming tools similar to Visio,
INCLUDING ERD's or Entity Relationship Diagrams...
see our suggestions at: 
Diagrams, Wireframing, Prototyping Tools - Adobe XD, Balsamic, Miro, More.
Try the above first, BEFORE asking for help with Visio with Mac.
If you need to use Visio specifically, but only have a Mac, email ihelp@drexel.edu.
 But ONLY if you are a Drexel CCI faculty or pro staff or student member
 & need Visio specifically
& nothing else can be used for a class assignment or Drexel University research.
Instructions
Visit https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/developer-tools/
This takes you to Microsoft's Azure Developer Tools homepage.
Click the blue ""Sign In"" button.
Login (if prompted) with DrexelOne or Drexel Connect credentials.
You may see Visio or other software you need right there
If not, proceed with next steps.
Click on your person icon in upper right.
Might be a picture you chose & different from screenshot below.
Click Azure Portal.
Close any help or info windows.
If you do NOT see Azure Portal, just move onto the next step below anyway.

Select “Education” under ""Azure services.""
May need to scroll down to see ""Azure services.""


Click ""Software"" in the left navigation pane to browse.
Or search ""Software."" 



Type in text in the ""Search"" text box to search for software/applications,
such as ""Visio""(without quotes). Just one example.
For this search, do *not* search in the ""Search resources, services, and docs (G + /)"" box.





Select “Visio Professional 2019 (Windows Only)” .
Or select whatever the software is you are looking for.



Copy the Download URL from right side panel.

If you already have the software installed, and it's the same year of software,
click ""View Key"" instead, and Google where in the software to enter the license key.
If that fails, you may need to reinstall the software.


Notes & Troubleshooting
IMPORTANT:
If you cannot find Visio or other software,
be sure you are logged in with your DrexelOne or Drexel Connect credentials.
*ALSO*, try logging in a different web browser,
and/or in a new private/incognito/inprivate tab or window
in both your preferred and a different web browser.


Choose a local account when you install Win 10.
Choose 64-bit versions of software, if offered.
If your laptop was made in 2011 or before, Google the laptop's make and model and whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit.
There are TWO Windows 10 Education keys/downloads available per user at Drexel at Azure Dev Tools.
Windows 10 Education is recommended for first use over Windows 10 Education N.
You can use either. Or you can use both if you have two different computers or VM's.
Difference between Windows 10 Education and Windows 10 Education N?
Windows 10 Education N is missing built-in media/video/audio/conferencing apps,
like Windows Media Player, Camera, Music, TV & Movies, Skype, etc.
Need a 3rd Windows 10 Education license?
ELMS/e-Academy Online/onthehub does offer Drexel students a 3rd Windows 10 Education license.
Login to https://one.drexel.edu/ (DrexelOne), click CAMPUS+COMMUNITY,
scroll down and look in the middle column for ""Hardware and Software,""
click ""eAcademy: Online Store"".
This is one way to get to the ELMS on onthehub for Drexel.
In the Featured or Microsoft areas, look for a Windows 10 Education icon, click it, click ""Add to Cart"" next to ""Free,"" go to your cart, checkout, and purchase (though no money will be involved).
Follow instructions on-screen or in email that gets sent to you.
This is Windows 10 Education, not Windows 10 Education N.

Written Instructions
First try to create a Qualtrics Survey on your own.
Go to DrexelOne at https://one.drexel.edu -> Login -> Click “CAMPUS+COMMUNITY.” 
Scroll down & look under the right “Technology Services” section. 
Click “Qualtrics” there.
If asked if you have an existing account, click or choose the “No” option.
Click “Submit” or whatever to proceed.
Click “Projects” in upper right. -> Create a new “Project.”
Click “Survey.”
Notes: If you cannot do that, check for an email from your professor, or from Qualtrics, that contains a “Collaboration” code. If you have such an email already, then use the numbered set of instructions at the bottom here regarding how to *enter the “Collaboration Code.”* Check Inbox (Focused and Other, if you use that), Deleted Items or Trash or Recycle Bin, Spam or Junk email folders.
If you do not have such an email, *then* your professor *first* needs to create & share a new Qualtrics Project that is a Survey with you and other group members, and your professor will need to do this for each student group. Instructions for this are below.
Students traditionally do *not* have access to use “Qualtrics.” So I’m not expecting the above to work, so if above doesn’t work, your professor should do the steps in the below section, and share that Qualtrics Project that is a Survey with your group. And *then* each student in a group should follow the instructions in how to *enter the “Collaboration Code”* section below.If the *first try to create a Qualtrics Survey on your own* section above does not work for you, and you do *not* have a “Collaboration Code” email.
Then your professor needs to *create and share a Qualtrics Project Survey*.
Instructions for the Professor
Go to DrexelOne at https://one.drexel.edu -> Login -> Click “CAMPUS+COMMUNITY.”
Scroll down & look under the right “Technology Services” section, and click “Qualtrics” there.
Click “Projects” link in upper right. -> Click “Create new project.” -> Click “Survey.”
For “Project Name,” enter the name of the student group. -> Click “Get Started.”
Make up some dummy question and type it into Q1’s “Click to write question text” area.
Make up some dummy responses to the above question in the “Click to write Choice #” options provided.
Click “Publish.” -> Then click “Publish” again. -> Click “Close.”
Click “Projects” link in upper right. -> Click the … or ellipsis icon for your new survey.
Click “Collaborate.”
Type in Drexel email addresses (short-form ones, preferable, but what you will) for the students in the group who need access.
Click “Save.”
The students will get a “Collaboration Code” email.
They should *ONLY* copy the code in the email.
Then *each student* should follow the steps in the section below to *enter the “Collaboration Code.”*
Once your professor does the above section’s steps, you all should get an email with a “Collaboration Code.”
Do NOT click anything in that email.
ONLY copy the “Collaboration Code” for use in the next steps.
It will NOT be the same code shown in the Drexel CCI tutorial video on this.
Now, go to DrexelOne at https://one.drexel.edu -> Login -> Click “CAMPUS+COMMUNITY.”
Scroll down & look under the right “Technology Services” section.
Click “Qualtrics” there.
If asked if you have an existing account, click or choose the “No” option.
Click “Submit” or whatever to proceed.
Click “Projects” in upper right.
Create a new “Project.”
Whatever type of project you can. Doesn’t matter.
If you can create a “Survey,” let us know.
Otherwise, make some Project, just type in “test” & go with default values and settings.
You will *NOT* use this “Project,” but you need to create a Project first.
Click the folder icon in the upper left.
Click “Shared with me” in left expanded panel.
Click “Accept collaboration” button.
Enter the “Collaboration Code” from the email, and click “Submit.”
If this still does not work, or you have issues, send screenshots of the furthest step you can get."

Handling SCAM SPAM or Phishing with Drexel Email
What is SCAM SPAM?
Email impersonating someone or something in order to get sensitive info, or put malware on your computer. Also, phishing, email fraud, or anything bad via email.
Reporting
Do this if you are certain, or even just feel it’s likely, that an email you receive is trying to SCAM someone or is malicious.
Create new email.
Subject line “SCAM” or what you will.
Drag SCAM SPAM email…
from Inbox, Junk, Trash or other folder...
to the message area or the body of the NEW email.
If you do not have the original email, use the next best thing you have.
Send the new email to mailabuse@drexel.edu .

If the email seems to be impersonating someone at Drexel CCI,
go ahead & email ihelp@drexel.edu but... IN A SEPARATE EMAIL ... if you haven't already.

Mark the original email as Junk or Spam. 
If you still have the original email.
Link below will show you how in Outlook if you do not know how.
Outlook -- Spam, Junk, Email Rules or Filters
If you use some other email app or program somehow, mark it as Junk or Spam in that app or program.
Identifying
If ANY of the following factors apply, it’s probably SCAM SPAM or PHISHING.
Emails asks you to buy something, or go somewhere.
ESPECIALLY IF you do not know, or rarely contact, the Drexel person or department or entity asking...
We promise the Dean does not want you to buy him a gift card or send him money directly. :-)
ANYONE AT ALL sends you an invoice or asks for money, and you were NOT expecting it.
Email asks you for contact or financial info or to call a number you do NOT recognize.
This line is in email message (body).
Caution: POSSIBLE IMPERSONATION; before you handle this message, confirm the sender’s identity per https://drexel.edu/SaferEmail
The word EXTERNAL appears at TOP of email message (body)...
But email says it is from Drexel person or department.
The email is from a non-Drexel email address...
But email says it is from Drexel person or department.
BUT IF YOU ARE JUST UNSURE, email ihelp@drexel.edu or mailabuse@drexel.edu .
Better safe than sorry.
REMEMBER! ALL Drexel business should be done through Drexel email!
Drexel faculty should adhere to this rule VERY closely.
We HIGHLY recommend this for students as well.
If students choose to forward their email to another email service,
we again HIGHLY recommend that the ""To"" field in emails
that student sends shows their actual Drexel email address (long form or short form).

How to Use XnResize
XnResize
XnResize is a bulk image editor/resizer for outputting multiple input images to the same format. Essentially, you can give it a bunch of images and it'll resize them all, rotate them all, gamma correct them.
Most IMPORTANTLY!
XnResize lets you change the width and height of multiple images, not just the file size as ImageOptim on Mac orPowerTools Image Resizer on Windows do.
Using XnResize as a bulk image resizer for width and height (images below)
Open XnResize, in the Select Photos tab, add multiple files or add a folder.
Adding a folder will add all the images within that directory and its subdirectories.
After adding the images you'd like to edit (all-at-once), select the Action tab. You can Resize it to the Width and Height of your choosing, keeping the ratio, and gamma correcting/resampling as need be.
 You can also Rotate, but only in increments of 90deg. This option is by default on so be careful to not leave this on if you don't need it.
RECOMMENDED SETTINGS for Action tab:
Check Resize, and under Resize, from the Presets drop-down, select the 50% option.
In the Resample drop-down menu, select Nearest Neighbor.
Uncheck Rotate box.
Make sure Keep ratio and Use gamma correction are checked.
Select Fill in the Mode drop-down menu.
Click Next.
If 50% doesn't work, delete the new images, reupload the original images, and try 75% in the Presets. Or manually adjust Width and Height percentage values as desired, with Keep ratio box checked. Keep the same settings for everything else.
The Output tab is where you specify where you want your output files to be. You can select the folder to output the files to. Default is the Download folder on Mac or Pac.
RECOMMENDED SETTINGS for Output tab:
Filename set to {Filename} .
Case set to No change. Start index is 0.
If you uploaded a folder, check Keep folder structure.
Uncheck Keep original date/time attributes.
Check Preserve Metadata and Preserve color profile.
Under Format, choose Same as original.
Click Convert.
After converting, click Back if you have more to conver.
Click Close if you are done. Close will close the program.

Office 365 -- Excel Forms or Forms - Extra Whitespace
When copying and pasting text into Excel Forms or Forms, unintended space may be found in between the text. To correct this:
Use a plain text editor (TextEdit, Notepad, Notepad++, Bb Edit, Atom, etc.) to show the hidden spaces in between text as visible characters
Be sure to convert the text into plain text if it has not been converted to plain text
From here, double check and remove any unnecessary spaces
Once the body of text is free of extra spaces, copy the text from the plain text editor and paste it into Forms
Note that when copying text from plain text editor, it may need to be copied twice in a row to actually paste over with the text with spaces."

Qualtrics
Introduction
A better alternative to Bb Learn Surveys is Qualtrics.
Drexel faculty and staff can access and use Qualtrics, a robust, easy-to-use online survey solution for free.
Student Use - Faculty Should Reach Out to ITG First
If you are a Drexel student, you must be authorized by a faculty or staff member in order to obtain a Qualtrics account.
A request should be sent by the faculty or staff member to itg@drexel.edu & include:
student(s) full name(s)
username(s)
reason a Qualtrics account is needed (e.g., course work or research).
Once the request has been approved, students will see a Qualtrics link appearing in DrexelOne under the Campus+Community tab, in the ""Technology Services"" channel.
Students should then follow the instructions below to access Qualtrics.
This and additional information can be found at https://drexel.edu/it/help/a-z/qualtrics/
Basic Instructions - for Faculty, Staff, and Students.
INSTRUCTORS! See the section above for how to set-up Qualtrics for student use. The above must be done BEFORE students can use the instructions below.
You can access Qualtrics through Drexel One (http://one.drexel.edu).
Once you login, click ""CAMPUS+COMMUNITY.""
Scroll to the bottom, and click ""Qualtrics"" in the bottom-right of the page under ""Technology Services.""
In the new tab/window, and if prompted whether you already have a Qualtrics account, 
click ""No, I do not have an Existing Account.""
Click “Projects” in upper right.
If are creating a new survey:
Click create a new “Project"" > “Survey.”

Qualtrics for Students -- Alternative or Work-Around Solution
See the Student Use section above for the non-work-around solution.
The non-work-around solution above is going to work much better.
In the unlikely event you cannot use the non-work-around solution...
for a work-around, Drexel students can also use Qualtrics if a faculty or staff member useds the ""Collaborate"" feature & then adds their email address to the Project/Survey.
BUT there are some special steps the student has to take to access the shared survey (covered at link below).
See below for the work-around solution.
But again, we recommend scrolling up and trying the non-work-around solution first above.

Zoom -- Scheduling for Someone Else -- Delegated Access
Introduction
As a best practice when scheduling for other professional staff or faculty, using Delegated Access is best.
It also is clearer to the attendees who’s meeting it is.
When scheduling department meetings you may use your Zoom account provided no other zoom meetings are scheduled at that time using said account.    
And provided you don’t have any conflicting zoom meetings scheduled that need immediate attention, the link below will show how to add scheduling privilege for another user.
Instructions
The process is fairly simple.
The person who wants someone else to schedule Zoom meetings on their behalf has to log in to their Drexel Zoom user account at https://drexel.zoom.us .
If prompted, please use the ""SSO"" or ""Sign in with SSO"" option,
but most will see a ""Sign in Standard"" button,
and should sign in with their Drexel userid and password.
And then add the Drexel email address to the schedule on behalf section.
The person who needs to schedule meetings on behalf of someone else cannot do so, until the other person gives them this access through https://drexel.zoom.us
Step by step instructions directly from Zoom:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362803-Scheduling-Privilege?mobile_site=true
If you want to schedule meetings on behalf of someone else, and cannot do so,
the other person gives the scheduler access through https://drexel.zoom.us
PLEASE ONLY USE https://drexel.zoom.us
If anyone at Drexel CCI needs hands on help doing this, have them email ihelp@drexel.edu , and we can walk them through it."

Zoom -- Closed Captioning and Removing TimeStamps
Introduction
Zoom provides captioning the form of a .vtt file if you record the Zoom meeting (at least for a cloud recording). A .vtt file is a time-stamped plain text file. A plain text file is a file that only has text (letters, numbers, special characters, white space) but no images, gifs, bold, italics, lines, graphics, colors, etc.
But because it is just text, there are good plain text editor programs that let you use something called regular expressions in order to do things like you ask, like removing time stamps.
Sample Zoom VTT Captions FileMac Instructions
On Mac, download a program called BBEdit.
https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/download.html
In Bb Edit, click “Search” > “Find”. In the “Find” box, copy from the following, and paste into that box.
Mac regular expression
(WEBVTT)*\n\n\d+\n\d\d:\d\d:\d\d\.\d\d\d --> \d\d:\d\d:\d\d\.\d\d\d\n\w+\s*\w*\s*\w+:
Note: There is an empty space (1 press of the spacebar on your keyboard) right after the \w+: at the end of the line above. Be sure to include that empty space.
In the “Replace” box, click your mouse cursor into the box, and press the spacebar once so there is 1 empty space in the box.
Make sure the “GREP” box is checked.
Click “Replace All.”
Click “View” > “Text Display” > “Soft Wrap”, if you don’t see all the text going down the page.
Select all, and copy/paste the text, now without timestamps, in a Word document
Windows Instructions
On a Windows 10 PC, download a program called Notepad++.
https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/
In Notepadd++, click “Search” > “Find”. Click the “Replace” tab.
In the “Find what” box, copy from the following, and paste into that box.
Windows regular expression

Note: There is an empty space (1 press of the spacebar on your keyboard) right after the \w+: at the end of the line above. Be sure to include that empty space.
In the “Replace with” box, click your mouse cursor into the box, and press the spacebar once so there is 1 empty space in the box.
Make sure the “Regular expression” box is checked.
Click “Replace All.”
Click “View” and make sure “Word Wrap” has a check next to it. If not, select “Word Wrap.” That will make all the text appear going down the page.

Tips for Managing Large Classes or Groups
When you mute everybody, you can uncheck a box to forbid students/participants to unmute themselves.
Let students know in each class by typing in the chat that you muted everyone
and that they cannot unmute themselves (until you ask for questions).
You can unmute all to allow students to ask questions when you are at a question time.
Or you can selectively unmute students in the Participants panel
who indicate in the chat that they have a question that needs a microphone.

Click Participants and Chat to open those panels when you are ready to take questions,
ask students to post in chat if they have a question
Verbally respond to short questions asked in the chat.
And unmute students who say they have a longer questions.
And just verbally guide students when it’s the question period.
Ask “Who has a question?
Ask short questions in chat,
or say in chat: ""If you want to take the mic, speak up in chat, and I’ll unmute you.”
If someone complains, mention that online meetings often end up with someone typing on a keyboard
or having sounds in the background that everyone in the meeting can hear
and is very distracting for anyone else listening in.
And it's hard to find the specific person,
and they sometimes take a long time to mute themselves,
and it disrupts the class further to ask and wait for someone to mute themselves.
So muting everyone is a way to quickly deal with that.
Rephrase the above as you wish, of course.

Rush 209 is infamous for intermittently developing an issue where either the computer display video feed or the room video feed in echo360 live broadcasts and recordings flashes (turns off and on).
Usually, only video one feed does this at a time.
We've never figured out a long term solution, but doing the following seems to solve the issue for awhile.
First, try rebooting the echo360 device, if possible. Then do the following. The podium key is needed to do this.
For how to reboot an echo360 device, see the following webpage.

   (a) The words ""echo360"" are on the back and front of the device.
Look for two cords going into two video input ports on the Echo360 device.
   (a) One is labeled ""Primary Display/Secondary Video""; the other, ""Primary Video/Secondary Display.""
         Below are the two video inputs ports.

         

         

Unplug the video cords and plug them into the opposite video input ports.
   (a) The cord that was plugged into ""Primary Display/Secondary Video"" should now be plugged into ""Primary Video/Secondary Display,"" and vice-versa.
See if that resolves the issue.
   (a) Ask the instructor to check with the students watching the live broadcast.
   (b) Or ask the CO-OP, or someone with admin echo360 access. to check the live broadcast, or make a test live echo360 broadcast and/or recording.
If the issue is resolved:
   (a) Close up and lock the back of the podium.
   (b) Put the podium key back where it belongs.
If the issue is not resolved:
   (a) If you don't know, ask instructor or CO-OP or someone if students are having problems with the computer display video feed or room video feed.
   (b) If students are having problems with the computer display feed:
            i.    Switch the video input cords again, and make sure the students are getting computer display feed without flashing.
            ii.   If you cannot get the computer display feed to work after switching back, or if both feeds are having a problem, reboot the echo360 device.
                     1.  For how to reboot an echo360 device, see the following webpage.
                             (a) echo360 -- Rebooting echo360 Devices in CCI Classrooms
            iii.  Wait 5-10 minutes for the echo360 device to fully boot up again.
   (c) Tell the instructor that there's nothing else you know to do to resolve the issue, and that you'll have to elevate it to the CO-OP or full time CCI technical staff.
            i.   If live feed is needed, ask the instructor if they want to use the Blackboard Ultra virtual conferencing tool through Bb Learn. Instructions for this are at the webpage below if they do.
                    1.  Bb Collaborate Ultra

Zoom -- Virtual Backgrounds
Introduction
You can use an image or movie in place of what is normally showing behind you when you share video in Zoom.
You do NOT need a green screen, but you can use one, or use any solid color material behind you, if you wish.
How to Add a Zoom Virtual Background -- in 5 Steps
Open the Zoom app on your computer.
a. Mac: Open a Finder window and click Applications folder, and look there. Or do a Spotlight Search using the Command and spacebar key combination (or Cmd and spacebar key combination, or ⌘ and spacebar key combination).
b. Windows: Go to Start menu or Windows menu, and search for Zoom, or look under Z in the list of all Applications or Programs.
Only if you are asked to sign in: click ""Sign in with SSO"" or ""SSO Sign in with SSO, & then type in ""drexel"" (no quotes) next to "".zoom.us"" and ""Continue,"" and click in your web browser to ""Open zoom.us"" or ""Open Zoom,"" and then login on the Drexel Connect webpage with Drexel userid and password.Click your initials (or avatar image) in upper right & then click ""Settings.""
If you want to add your own Virtual Background, click the + sign, and then ""Add Image"" and ""Add Video,"" and upload your image or video (see More Tips below).
If you want to choose from the pre-existing Virtual Backgrounds, or from one you already loaded, choose one of the images under ""Choose Virtual Background.""
         
Once you choose a Virtual Background, it will instantly appear as soon as you show video of yourself in a Zoom meeting, or instantly if you are showing video of yourself.
You can close the ""Settings"" window now.
Change or Disable Virtual Background in a Zoom Meeting
Follow the steps indicated in screenshot below.
Then click ""None"" for no background. Or choose one of your other Zoom Virtual Backgrounds.
              
More Tips
""Mirror my video"" checkbox (shown above) can help make text that reads backwards read correctly, but check with someone in a Zoom meeting for how the text reads.
Images should be 16:9 aspect ratio and 1280 x 720. PNG or JPG images work fine. Or just try it out (unless it's a really, really big file). 
Videos should be MP4 or MOV with a minimum resolution 360p (480 x 360 pixels) & maximum resolution of 1080p (1920 by 1080 pixels). Or just try it out (unless it's a really, really big file). 
If you use your background image or movie with a very large meeting or that is open to the public, be sure you have the rights to use the image. 
If you use a green screen or other solid-color backdrop use (not required):
Your clothing should not be the same color as your green screen or other solid-color backdrop.
You also may not get much added benefit from flattening or straightening out or smoothing out any green screen or other solid-color backdrop, but feel free to try.
To enable use in Zoom of green screen or other solid-color backdrop, follow steps below.
Not shown: After doing steps below, your mouse pointer becomes a plus sign (cross hairs, really), and you can click the color in your video you want to use as your green screen or solid-color backdrop color.

Siri Dictation -- Apple iPad, iPhone, macOS -- Not Recommended
Use Siri for voice dictation on your Mac laptop or your iPhone or iPad.
It is not great.
If you talk at a normal speed without much pause for 20 seconds to a couple minutes, Siri stops writing down what you speak.
Still, if for some reason, you have some issues getting the above working, or you want to just try this, here are directions. Maybe it will work better for you.
If you go this route, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND talking without much pause for a couple minutes, and trying to have someone else do the same.
You’ll need to open up a note on your Mac or iPhone or iOS device or even Word, and then get Siri going.

https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203741855-Cloud-recording
Zoom Auto Copies or Backs-Up to Kaltura
Drexel cloud recordings automatically back up to Kaltura or Drexel Streams (Drexel's video repository)
at https://drexel.edu/it/streams (Drexel Streams = Kaltura).
These videos are also easily accessible from within Bb Learn.
This makes it SUPER EASY to submit videos for assignments.

Editing Zoom Recordings - Do Not Use Zoom
Zoom's video editing only works when shared from Zoom, not when you download recordings.
For editing, we recommend...
Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Edit Video or Video Settings
-or-
OpenShot Video Editor
Then upload to Kaltura or Drexel Streams using Adding Media to Bb Learn via Kaltura or Drexel Streams
Alternate Method -- Share Kaltura or Drexel Streams
Good for sharing outside of Drexel Bb Learn or with non-Drexel people, or if you run into issues with above method. See link below.

Zoom recording taking a long time to process?
Short recordings should process quick.
For long recording, give it 3-6 hours for 2-3 hours of recording.
And ALSO make sure the Host ended the Zoom meeting rather than just left.
To do so, re-enter the Zoom meeting.
Click End > End Meeting for All.
Downloading Online or Cloud Recordings
Here is how to download online or cloud recordings.
Login to https://drexel.zoom.us with DrexelConnect userid & password.
Click the ""Recordings"" link in the left navigation.
Click the link for your recording under ""Topic.""
Click ""Download # Files"" (# will be any number).
   (a) If prompted, click to allow download of multiple files.
Choose where to save each file.
Open downloaded .mp4 files. Make sure your have right ones.
Any Zoom videos kept more than 18 weeks starting June 1, 2020 will be taken down.
(Email sent first, purportedly, but don't count on that!)
Accessing Recordings if Alt Host or Privileged Scheduler
Only the real host can access the recordings. The other 2 can get emails when the recording is ready on the Host's account.

Recording to Computer
Recording to the Cloud is still recommended over recording to your computer, as it will save you time and effort, but Zoom has made Recording to the Computer less of an ordeal if the post-meeting processing window and, well, process is closed before finished. Zoom stores pre-processed recordings as .zoom files on your computer on Windows and Mac in the Documents folder in the Zoom folder. Do NOT change the name of the .zoom files. Each .zoom file will have a name similar to ""double_click_to_convert.."" If you do not have an .mp4, mf4a, and/or .m3u files and just .zoom files, just double-click the one or more .zoom files, and let the processing start and finish. The .zoom files will disappear after the conversion is over. Again, we generally recommend Recording to the Cloud, as it's still the easier and more sure method, but it's nice to know Recording to the Computer has been dramatically improved by Zoom.
Recordings are stored locally on the host's computer. You can go into Zoom's settings to find the location of the recording.

Some things to know about Google Meet
Google Meet has very low security so please email or send the link to only those who should join the meeting. 
Google Meet meeting hosts cannot explicitly block someone from joining the meeting so, do not share the meeting link publicly.
Google Meet meeting recordings are stored in Google Drive. Everyone with a free Google account will only get 15GB of storage on Google Drive. You can always transfer recordings from Google Drive to Kaltura Drexel Streams to free up storage on Google Drive but, If the meeting is going to be long enough to require more than 15GB of storage to store the recording then Google Meet is not recommended.

Zoom -- Invalid Meeting ID or Invalid Meeting Number
If you click a Zoom meeting link,
and you get an error that says something like:
""Invalid Meeting ID"" or ""Invalid Meeting Number,""
here's what to do.
Check the original Zoom meeting link information you were provided in an email or on a website.
Check that the Meeting ID number in the web address of the Zoom link (URL or web address),
or that the Zoom link in general of the web address,
is correct.
If this was in a class, also look in the Bb Learn course section where the link was originally shared.
Again, check that the Meeting ID number or that Zoom link in general of the web address posted in Bb Learn is what you are using.
Sometimes, an instructor or TA may need to change a Zoom link.
And it's possible you missed an email.
Or the instructor or TA didn't get a chance yet to inform you of the changed Zoom link.
Also, try one or more the following:
Sign out of the Zoom app on your computer.
Sign out of Zoom in the web browser
Sign back in at https://drexel.zoom.us/.
Sign into your Zoom app using your Drexel account.
And use the SSO option to sign in.
Enter ""drexel.zoom.us"" if prompted.
Or ""drexel"" (no quotes) before "".zoom.us.""
Then try clicking the Zoom link again.
If you have questions on SSO sign-in for Drexel Pro accounts, see the following:

Introduction
Kaltura Drexel Streams is the recommended video and audio repository for Bb Learn or any Drexel videos. One Kaltura audio or video file in Bb Learn can be shared in multiple different Bb Learn course sections, conserving server storage space. And Kaltura video is easily playable by students and instructors in the major internet browsers.
IMPORTANT!!!!!
Do NOT link to Zoom cloud recordings! They are deleted in 18 weeks.
ONLY use Kaltura Drexel Streams when uploading videos to Bb Learn.
Do NOT upload videos directly to Bb Learn!
It slows down Bb Learn & costs the university MUCH more money.
Simple Instructions
Go to your Bb Learn course section.
Enter a ""Week"" or other content area.
Click ""Build Content"" > ""Kaltura Media.""
Wait 5-10 seconds.
Select your video.
Or...
Click ""+Add Media"" and upload media.
Follow the on-screen instructions.
Example of a content area.
Many content areas are ""Week 1"" or ""Week 2"" or similar.

Getting a Camtasia License
If you would like to get the latest version of Camtasia or upgrade your existing version, you will need to attend an online training session with DU IT (formerly Drexel IRT).
Online Camtasia training involves reviewing 10 videos online and 1 document and taking the Camtasia Proficiency Quiz, which will make you eligible for having DU IT set-up a new Camtasia license on your computer.
The DU IT training videos and document, and the Camtasia Proficiency Quiz, are all available at the webpage below.
http://drexel.edu/it/services/workshops/web-based/cam-cross-platform/
NOTE: If you import a video clip into Camtasia, Camtasia now auto-adjusts audio levels. The original clip file’s audio levels remain unchanged.
I Want A Camtasia License NOW!
Visit the website below, skip down to & click to expand ""Module 11,"" and take the quiz. You need an 80% or 85% or so to pass. You can retake the quiz if you get a lower score. Once you pass, itg@drexel.edu will send you an email to set-up a license on your computer and within Self Service or Software Center. You have to pass the quiz, but once you do, if you are in a hurry, email itg@drexel.edu in a separate email, and let them know. Also, try calling 215-895-1224 and leave a message, and ask for a pro staff member to contact you soon and get this added.

Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Allow Downloads
Introduction & Notes
In order to allow downloads in a Bb Learn course section, you have to copy/paste in an ""Unlisted"" direct link to a Kaltura Drexel Streams video, and anyone with the link can play or download the video.
Downloading Drexel Streams or Kaltura video is NOT necessary, generally.
You can play Drexel Streams or Kaltura videos fine in your web browser.
If you are not the creator/owner of the video, downloading a video is complicated.
Downloading video is not necessary for submitting assignments, generally.
Few instructors need it. A few may want it, and will tell you that, but very, very, very few will actually need it.
Recordings cannot be downloaded from an embedded player window in Bb Learn.
Links to the video on the Drexel Streams website can allow downloads.
Downloading
Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Downloading
Allow Downloads
Find & click your video under ""My Media"" in Kaltura Drexel Streams.
https://drexel.edu/it/streams
or...
https://1513041.mediaspace.kaltura.com/
Scroll down. Click ""ACTIONS"" > ""Edit"" > ""Downloads"" > ""Source"" checkbox > ""Save.""
Click ""Go to Media"" to return to normal view of video.
Scroll down. Click ""ACTIONS"" > ""Publish"" >  ""Unlisted"" > ""Save.""
The video will be viewable by anyone with the link.
No Drexel login required.

If you want people to login to see the video (otherwise go to next step):
you need to create a channel (just once) that only people with Drexel accounts can access in Kaltura Drexel Streams.
Here's how:
Scroll up & click your name in the upper right. Click ""My Channels."" Enter ""Drexel CCI Videos"" for ""Name (Required)."" Scroll down to ""Privacy"" & select ""Restricted."" Click ""Save.""
Go back to the video. 
Now, for this and any future videos you want in this channel:
click ""ACTIONS"" > ""Publish"" >  ""Public"" > check ""Drexel CCI Videos"" > ""Save.""

Click ""Share"" (under the video).
Copy/paste the link to the video into your Bb Learn course section,
or where you wish to share this video.
The video can be viewed by anyone with the the link.
More Info
The methods we offer above are easiest to implement.
Another method is to host your videos within your OneDrive folder and setting the share option so anyone can download the videos who has the share link for the OneDrive folder. Or limit the share to anyone at Drexel. Link below explains how to do this.
Office 365 -- OneDrive Sharing Files and Folders
You could also create your own Kaltura Drexel Streams channels and manage user enrollment for them, but that is a lot of extra work for what might be very little result.
If you want to try one of these other methods:
To share the video in Kaltura Drexel Streams, you may also want to look making someone a co-viewer, co-editor, or co-publisher. They need to find the video in Kaltura Drexel Streams under ""My Media"" once you do this.

Echo Occurring?
Everyone in the same physical room as the host user should *mute their computer microphones and computer speaker volume.*
The host user is the exception. The host user should NOT mute their computer microphone and computer speakers UNLESS the host use is using a phone or speakerphone for audio. 
If the host user is using a phone or speakerphone for audio, then the host indeed should mute their computer microphone and computer speakers.
Screen Freeze or Lag? Delayed Audio?
Have all participants mute their audio and/or shut down their video when they are not using it.
All participants should close any open applications or browser tabs or windows they are not using during the meeting.
   (a) Closing non-essential apps in the lower right (System Tray) in Windows or upper right (Menu Bar) in Mac could help as well.

General Tips
Try the above tips *FIRST,* and only do the ones below if the issues persist.
Screen sharing or application sharing of very high resolution or 4K displays can sometimes be a factor.
Ask presenters to change their display resolution to something closer to 1920x1080 (which is still HD).
Participants on their own personal WiFi or other network might to try shutting down any other devices on their personal WiFi network to increase the overall available bandwidth.
Do not use https://zoom.us for Drexel Zoom.
Use https://drexel.zoom.us for Drexel Zoom.
Only host 1 meeting at a time on your own account.
Drexel Zoom meetings can be schedule to last as long as 24 hours long, if need be.
Zoom meetings recorded to the cloud are captioned and transcribed automatically and available to those who attend.
The captioning and transcript are not good enough for students or instructors who need special accommodations.
International participants can use Zoom to hear and be heard for free through their computer.
International phone rates apply if the phone is used for audio.

Try SSO Sign-In Instructions for Zoom First
Zoom -- SSO Single Sign-On and Host Sign-In
Written Instructions
Basically, you want to make sure you are signed into the Zoom application installed on your computer. And signed out of the wrong zoom website in your web browser. This can fix many login issues, and will let you login with your Drexel Account after clicking a Zoom meeting link. If you scheduled/created the Zoom link, you will be the Host.
Here's how:
Without clicking a Zoom link,
open the Zoom program or application.
Mac: Look in your Applications folder in Finder or Spotlight Search.
Windows: Look in the Start menu.
Cannot find Zoom?:
Zoom may not be installed. Go to https://drexel.zoom.us > ""Sign In Standard"" > login to Drexel Connect > ""Host a Meeting"" (video on or off) > download/install > open/run Zoom or zoom .us.
Click ""zoom .us"" menu
Click ""Sign In.""
Or click ""File"" > ""Sign in.""
Click ""Sign Out"" if signed in already!
Then repeat step #3 above.
Click “SSO Sign in with SSO” or “Sign In with SSO.""
Type in “drexel” (without quotes) next to “. zoom. us”. And click “Continue.”If prompted & if your web browser opens to the Drexel Connect webpage, sign in with your Drexel userid and password.
Click ""Open link.""
Or click “Open zoom .us""
Or click ""Open Zoom"" or similar.
If prompted & if your web browser opens to the Drexel Connect webpage,
sign in with your Drexel userid and password.
Now, quit the Zoom application.
But do *not* sign out in the Zoom application.
You can sign out of Zoom in your web browser if you wish now.
Just not the Zoom application itself.
To sign out of Zoom in a web browser (if you wish):
Click “Drexel University Zoom” > “Sign In Standard” > person icon in upper right > “SIGN OUT”.
No need to click “DISCONNECT” unless you want to sign out of all standard Drexel websites.
Now, if you click a Zoom meeting link that you created/scheduled, you will enter as a Host.
And for other Zoom meetings links, you will enter with your Drexel Account.

echo360 -- Downloading Lecture Recordings
Instructions
Get to your Echo360 recordings in your Bb Learn course section, click “echo360 Class Recordings” in left navigation panel in Bb Learn course section.

Click “Access echo360 Class Recordings for INFO-634-001/900-XLIST-201925”.
Italicized course number be different for you.

In the row of the date of the recording:

Click the green or gray arrow button.
Scroll down if necessary.
Click ""Download original.
Choose to download either (a) the computer display video with audio, (b) the room video with audio, or (c) audio only.
Click resolution (standard definition is SD, high definition is HD).
Click ""Download.""
Download and save the media file to your computer


Re-Use of Recordings After Current Quarter -- for Instructors Only
Echo360 recordings do not copy between Bb Learn course sections when Bb Learn Admins like Mike Galloway copy course materials.
But you can download the recordings and use Kaltura Drexel Streams to upload the recordings again to your next quarter's Bb Learn course section (when it's available to you).
Once you add any video using Kaltura Drexel Streams, the videos do then copy over during course copy. So you won't have to add them again.
See above for how to download recordings from Bb Learn
Here is how to add video to a Bb Learn course section using Kaltura Drexel Streams
Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Kaltura Capture
Troubleshooting
Cannot see the ""Download original"" option or ""Download"" button shown above?
Try using the scrollbar on the right, if one is present. If multiple scrollbars, try both.
Another thing to try is to put 2 fingers on your touchpad without clicking it and swipe up or down.
If neither solution works, click Start > Settings > System > Display. Scroll down to “Scale and layout.” Change the drop-down menu option to 75% or 50% or try some options that are 100%. Click “Keep” or “OK” to retain your changes. You can change them back later. Go to Echo360 now, refresh the webpage, and try again. If this work, repeat the first part of the instructions in this paragraph, but this time, change the drop-down menu back to 100% or whatever you preferred level is.
If that doesn’t work, click Start > Settings > System > Display. Scroll down to “Resolution.” Try some of the higher (bigger number) resolution options, if any are available. Click “Keep” or “OK” to retain your changes. You can change them back later. Go to Echo360 now, refresh the webpage, and try again. If this work, repeat the first part of the instructions in this paragraph, but this time, change the drop-down menu back to 100% or whatever you preferred level is.
More problems downloading a lecture recording?
Try logging out of Bb Learn, closing your internet browser completely, waiting 20 seconds, then re-opening your internet browser, logging again to Bb Learn at https://dcollege.learn.net, and trying to download the recording again.
If that doesn’t work, try a different internet browser.
And be sure there are no hidden window prompts behind any open windows you have that are waiting for a response or click from you.
Hidden window prompts might not appear as a clickable square icon in your bottom taskbar in Windows or bottom dock on a Mac.
If none of that helps, contact us using the information below."

Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Analytics
Stats with Analytics are Problematic
If you really want to track who watched a video, we recommend using a Kaltura Quiz, if only to have a single quiz question not more than 20 seconds before the end of the video, where a student or others confirms they watched it.
To create a Kaltura Quiz, see:
Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Quizzes in Videos
Even if you ask students to disable ad blocking, privacy enhancing, fingerprint spoofing, or script disrupting plug-ins, add-ons, extensions, or built-in functionality, we've had too many instances of not being able to tell if a student completely watched a video or not.
Kaltura Quizzes on the other hand are entirely dependable.
ALSO, if you need to know through analytics the userid of a student or someone,
they need to access the video through a Bb Learn course section at https://learn.dcollege.net
or after signing into Kaltura Drexel Streams at:
https://drexel.edu/it/streams/

More Information on How to Interpret Analytics
https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/kaltura-analytics


Troubleshooting Analytics
First, make sure when you run reports or look at the stats that you are actually looking at the stats for the current month or 2 you or time period you actually want to look at. Also, consider in the future using the quiz option to track students, rather than analytics. If you don't go with the quiz option, here's what you can send to students who claim they watched the video.
As a student, there are a couple things you can do on your end to help convince your TA or Instructor you watched the videos. None of these may prove you watched the video all the way through, but all/most combined may provide enough circumstantial evidence that you did. So do all of the suggestions below that you can.
We also have a page of suggestions for how to improve your home internet dependability, also included below, in case that was a factor.
First, visit Drexel Streams (Kaltura videos homepage for Drexel) at https://drexel.edu/it/streams and login. Click your name in the upper right. Then click ""My History."" Take a screenshot that shows the date and time you watched the one or more videos in question. This won't show you watched the videos all the way through or not, but it will confirm you clicked on them. If you're not sure how to take a screenshot, visit https://take-a-screenshot.org .
Second, visit the link below and explore your web browsing history. See if you can find not only the date/time you watched the Kaltura video in Bb Learn, and it might be an https://learn.dcollege.net link (the one where the video relies), and not a https://1513041.mediaspace.kaltura.com/ but look for instances of webpages containing both of those as the start of the URL or web address. Take screenshots. And see provide other webpage history dates/times to show you weren't going to other webpages. Use the basic photo editor built into your computer (Paint, Paint 3D, Preview) and the colored pen or marker or line or box tools to cover up webpage URLs you don't want the instructor to see (if any). You'll need to repeat this step for each video you feel you unfairly lost points on, and it will still be up to the instructor to decide if you get points or not. They do not have to give you points if they do not want to.

The following webpage may help with this. If not, Google how to find your web browser's history. Do NOT clear your cache or your history. https://www.wikihow.com/View-Browsing-History.

If you cannot find that you watched these videos in your viewing history, for future incidents like this, make sure you are not using Private or InPrivate or Incognito tabs. Make sure AdBlock or uBlock or Ghostery or other privacy enhancing extensions or add-ons are disabled. Allow cookies if you disallowed them. If you frequently clear your browsing history and cache, or use any of these other features or add-ons or extensions, you may not have the ability to find what you previously watched.

Send the screenshots you find to your TA or Instructor to make the case you watched one or more of these videos. 

Note:
It is completely your TA's or Instructor's decision whether to agree you watched a video or no. There's no backend record you or your instructor do not already have access to that will show you watched these videos.

Accidental entry of shortcut commands on the keyboard are the reason why your zoom meeting may accidentally mute or pause/resume recordings.
It's possible that the host/co-host may tap or hit one of these key combinations,
and you can accidentally mute/unmute yourself or the entire room (depending if you are the host or not).
You can also pause or resume recordings if you are the host.

ROUGH DRAFT!!!
Recommend doing just a recording first using OBS Studio. See the webpage below for instructions.
OBS Studio
If you use an external microphone, muting ""mic/aux"" is recommended to avoid echo effect in recording or streaming.
You may need to create and show a Live Video on a Page you manage for Facebook Live.
Go to ""Settings"" to adjust where videos are saved to, the format that they are saved in, and to set the live stream key and service (Facebook, YouTube).
You may want to create additional separate Google and Facebook accounts (use your own name) but with high privacy settings to do testing of Facebook Live and YouTube Live.
For Drexel CCI events, Mike Galloway will need to log you in to post on Facebook and YouTube.

Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Video Assignments or Discussion Board Posts in Bb Learn
Introduction
Because Kaltura is embedded in Bb Learn, and available to students in Discussion Board posts or Assignment submissions in Bb Learn, it easily lends itself to creating assignments where you want students to record videos, and they can submit this using Discussion Board post replies or Assignment submissions.

Below is how to set this up for them, and a link to provide students to explain how they do the assignment.
Instructions using Discussion Board (Forums or Weeks)
Just have students embed videos they create into Discussion Board posts using the Kaltura tool,
or copy/pasting a link from a video they uploaded to Drexel Streams into a Discussion Board post.
You can set 1 or more Discussion Board forums on the Discussion Board page to be gradeable.
Use Grade by Forum when editing DB options.
You have to edit the options for each forum individually. :-(
If you are not sure how to create or edit a Discussion Board forum, in a Week or content area or otherwise, see:
Discussion Boards -- Creating, Modifying and Hiding Forums
Once you have a Discussion Board assignment created,
send the following instructions to your students,
and just direct them to use the Kaltura tool to post or reply there with their video.

Zoom not working and Troubleshooting
Basic Troubleshooting
Make sure webcam is not covered.
Uninstall Zoom completely from the computer Zoom isn't working on.
How to uninstall in Windows 10.
Download & install Zoom again.
Use the SSO or Single-sign on option to sign in.
Screenshare Shortcut Key
If someone cannot figure out how to screenshare, especially if you are trying to assist them, tell them to use the following shortcut key combination
Alt + S
Tell them to press and hold the Alt key. And then keep the Alt key held down, while they tap the S key once. Repeat these instructions slowy for a non-tech savvy user.
This shortcut allows the user to screen-share without having to find the share button
Echoes and Sound Artifacts
If possible, use a headset with a microphone, or AirPods or very good alternatives.
NO cheap bluetooth headphones with mics!
Your own external speakers play audio that the microphone picks up.
And others in the meeting could have the same thing going on.
It's a lot for echo cancellation to handle at times.
AirPods or headsets reduce what microphones pick-up, except for your own voice.
Everyone in the same physical room as the host user
should *mute their computer microphones and computer speaker volume.*

The host user is the exception.
The host user should NOT mute their computer microphone and computer speakers...
UNLESS the host use is using a phone or speakerphone for audio.
Then the host indeed should mute their computer microphone & computer speakers.
Zoom Lags or Freezes or Audio is Delayed
Try one or more of these suggestions.
All hosts, presenters, panelists, or participants:
mute your audio if you are not speaking much.
All hosts, presenters, panelists, or participants:
turn off your video, unless truly needed.
Instructors or others requiring video to appear may need to be flexible on that requirement.
If someone is screen sharing, have that person stop,
and adjust the resolution on their computer to 1920 x 1080p (or i) or below.
Then re-share screen.
Any scaling you choose is fine.
Close any open applications or browser tabs or windows not needed for the meeting.
Closing non-essential apps in the lower right (System Tray) in Windows,
or upper right (Menu Bar) in Mac, if you can.
Click the ^ in Windows (lower right) and right-click.
Close any messaging apps, Adobe apps, Microsoft apps not needed for this meeting.
Leave the Zoom meeting.
Update the Zoom app installed on your computer.
Re-enter the meeting.
Try updating Zoom. See link below.
Zoom Updating or Updates
Participants on their own personal WiFi network
might to try shutting down any other devices
on their personal WiFi network

Zoom Crashes
Try one or more of these suggestions.
See what we suggest in the Zoom Lags or Freezes or Audio is Delayed section above.
If you are using another application, and Zoom is crashing:
uninstall/reinstall that application.
Use with OneNote has been an issue at times. Close OneNote.
Close and use less than 8 tabs in whatever web browser you have. 
Removing unknown or unused add-ons and extensions and clearing cache/history can help.
Link below has instructions.
Clear Browser Cache & History.
Do not use ""Gallery"" mode. It is resource intensive.
More info:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362323-Changing-the-video-layout-Active-Speaker-View-and-Gallery-View-
Uninstall & reinstall Zoom.
Reboot your device.
In the Zoom app, go to
Settings > Video Settings > Advanced.
Under ""Use hardware acceleration for"", uncheck ALL option.
If you still have problems after trying all the above,
try to change ""Video Rendering Method"" to ""Direct3D11.""
You may also want to Google this:
Best Zoom Video Rendering Method
and include the make, model, and/or OS of your computer in the search phrase.
If the above does not help, doing a more thorough update of drives, BIOS,
and such can help in Windows.

Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Capture
Tagged with: audio capture
Introduction
Great for voice-over PowerPoint presentations, Kaltura Capture lets you record anything you do on your computer screen as a video with audio. Kaltura Capture is an option within the Kaltura tool in Bb Learn, or within Drexel Streams. Once you stop the recording, you can easily upload to Bb Learn via the Kaltura tool.  Or to Drexel Streams, from which you can either upload to Bb Learn or share in other ways.
ExpressCapture is NOT the same thing as Kaltura Capture. You cannot screen record with ExpressCapture.
Advantage of Kaltura Capture?  The videos you make and upload to Kaltura or Drexel Streams and use in Bb Learn can allow viewers or students to make either the webcam video or the recorded screen video the larger or the more primary focus in the video at any time. 
Quick Instructions -- Bb Learn
Enter a Bb Learn course section at https://learn.drexel.edu . Click ""Courses."" Click your course.
Enter a ""Week"" or other content area in the Bb Learn course section.
Click ""Build Content"" > ""Kaltura Media"" > ""+Add Media"" > ""Kaltura Capture.""
Follow the on-screen instructions.
Alternative Quick Instructions -- Drexel Streams
Visit Drexel Streams at https://drexel.edu/it/streams .
Click ""+Add Media"" > ""Kaltura Capture.""
Follow the on-screen instructions.
To add to Bb Learn after recording & uploading to Drexel Streams:
Enter a Bb Learn course section at https://learn.drexel.edu . Click ""Courses."" Click your course.
Enter a ""Week"" or other content area in the Bb Learn course section.
Click ""Build Content"" > ""Kaltura Media"" > ""+Add Media"" 
Quick Troubleshooting
Kaltura Capture has been a memory HOG in the past. The issue has been reported and may be resolved on some OS's or browsers. 
However, you may want to close non-essential applications before using Kaltura Capture.
And disable any ad blockers or privacy enhancing web browser plug-ins or add-ons for the Bb Learn and Drexel Streams websites, if you use any.
Also, open the applications you need for your recording before you start recording. Outlook, for example, in the past would't open while Kaltura Capture was in use. It had to be opened previously.
And if you run into persistent issues, try the other alternatives below for making screen recordings.

Zoom -- Scheduling for Someone Else -- Recording Access
The original Host of the meeting, or person whose Zoom account was used to schedule the meeting, is the only one who can access and share the recordings.
And in this situation, we recommend Record to Cloud.
The original Host or above person is the ONLY one who can share the recording with others.
However, alternative hosts and those with scheduling privileges can get email notices that this recording is ready under the original Host's account.
Again, alternative hosts cannot actually access the recordings, nor can those with scheduling privileges on behalf of the original Host. Only the Host can access the recordings and actually share them.
But alternative hosts and those with scheduling privileges can get an email when that recording is ready under the original Host's account.
Here's how.
Have the original Host visit https://drexel.zoom.us and sign in.
Click Settings > Meeting [not Meetings] > Email Notifications.
Make sure ""When a cloud recording is available"" is switched on under ""Email Notification.""
Check either or both of the following, depending on who you want to get email notifications:
""Send a copy to the person who scheduled the meeting/webinar for the host.""
""Send a copy to the Alternative Hosts.""

Zoom -- Leave Computer Audio
Introduction
When supporting events or using speakers, we often run the Zoom meeting from the Windows ""tiny PC"" in the conference room's or classroom's podium or lectern. 
Then we have the guest speaker join without audio. Why? So they don't have to connect anything for AV. 
But also...This allows other people in the room to present more easily from their own laptops (multiple-presenter scenario). Zoom meetings would otherwise require massive delays between each presentation, disconnecting one speaker's laptop and then connecting another. 
CCI Commons Student Assistants (SA's) will ask at the start of a presentation if anyone else needs to present and set them up in Zoom using these instructions. 
This page explains how to do this for both new Student Assistants & people running Zoom meetings themselves.
Instructions
There are *7* steps!
Open the Zoom browser or application & start a Zoom meeting.
When the meeting starts, a pop-up will prompt you about Computer Audio, click the 'X' icon or close the pop-up.
Windows 10/11 screenshot below.


Mac screenshot below.
  Another pop-up will ask if 'you want to continue without audio?' Select the 'Continue' button.
Next to the 'mute'/microphone icon on the bottom bar, click the '^' button.
Click the 'Leave Computer Audio' button on the list of settings after completing the previous step.  
 The bottom bar will have a 'Join Audio'/headphone icon appear. 

 Now you have successfully disconnected from your computer's audio on Zoom."

Good Steps You Can Take to Be More Secure
There are several easy steps you can take, all optional, to increase privacy and security.
Enabling these features with a class or a large meeting will make it more difficult for students to enter.
Assign passwords in meetings with Drexel & non-Drexel people 
or require Drexel authentication if the meeting is all Drexel faculty/staff/students.
Drexel authentication means only Drexel Zoom account users can join.
Passwords allow Drexel & non-Drexel people to join the Zoom meeting, if they have the password.

Turn on Enable Waiting Room.
You will have to allow attendees in as they arrive.
Great for office hours.
Login to https://drexel.zoom.us > click ""Sign In Standard"" > ""Meetings"" >
""Schedule a Meeting"" > ""Waiting Room"" > ""Save.""

Turn off Join Before Host (if you are not using Waiting Room).
Login to https://drexel.zoom.us > click ""Sign In Standard"" > ""Meetings"" >
""Schedule a Meeting"" > ""Show"" next to ""Options"" at bottom >
uncheck ""Allow participants to join anytime"" > ""Save.""

Turn off Automatically Record to the Cloud.

For individual meetings:
Login to https://drexel.zoom.us > click ""Sign In Standard"" > ""Meetings"" >
""Schedule a Meeting"" > ""Show"" next to ""Options"" at bottom >
uncheck ""Automatically record meeting"" > ""Save.""

For all meetings:
Login to https://drexel.zoom.us > click ""Sign In Standard"" > ""Settings"" >
click toggle right/blue for ""Automatic Recordings.""

Restrict screen sharing to host.

Login to https://drexel.zoom.us > click ""Sign In Standard"" > ""Meetings"" >
search for ""Screen sharing"" > ""Host Only"" for both options > ""Save.""
Revert back later if needed for future meetings.

Do NOT use your ""Personal Room"" for most meetings. 
Just for meetings with co-workers of less than handful of people.

Direct Drexel students/staff/faculty to ensure they are logged in to Drexel Zoom Pro account.

Video Recording, Editing, and/or Adding to Bb Learn -- aka Screen Record
What is a Screen Recorder?
Screen recorders record your computer/laptop/mobile display, along with audio from when you speak. Webcam video optionally can be added as well. You can make voice-over PowerPoint presentation videos, or demos of whatever you want that is showing on your computer/laptop/mobile display.
Quick Tips:
Drexel CCI students can store (and are encouraged to store) videos for classes in Kaltura. To help create that video, screen recorders and editors provided below.
Zoom is a fine screen recorder: Hold a meeting with just yourself, and record to the cloud.
Kaltura’s screen recorder is awful (memory issues).
Kaltura does have limited editing abilities that can be useful, but extensive editing is not advised.

Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Share Audio or Video with Non-Drexel Users or Sharing with Anyone
Introduction
Drexel Streams at https://drexel.edu/it/streams lets you modify the sharing permissions to Unlisted on videos you upload and quickly copy a link you can paste into emails or anywhere to share with others. Unlisted is much better than any Published video option for this, generally. You have to UPLOAD videos to Kaltura or Drexel Streams first. For how to do that, see: Adding Media to Bb Learn via Kaltura or Drexel Streams . This is ALSO a useful way of just copy/pasting in a usable link into discussion board posts & assignment submissions in Bb Learn.If not yourself, consult with the owner/creator of the audio or video before sharing the video with Non-Drexel Users.

The bottom of the Handbrake window, between the ""Save As"" and the file name, and the ""Browse"" button, will tell you where the outputted smaller file will end up.
A notification will appear when finished to ""Put down that cockatil..."", and the converted video file will be ready, and will be a smaller file size.

Click ""ACTIONS,"" and click ""Edit.""


Click ""Collaboration,"" and click ""+Add Collaborator.""
(a) Check ""Co-Editor"" and/or ""Co-Publisher"" or ""Co-Viewer.""
(b) ""Co-Editor"" means they can make changes to the video or its settings.
(c) ""Co-Publisher"" means they can publish the video a Bb Learn course section, or elsewhere.
 

Click ""Add.""


The other person should now appear under Media Collaborators, and will be able to edit your video, or publish it to your Bb Learn course section.

Lightworks video editor
Lightworks is a free-to-use video editor. You get a 7-day trial and then you must register to continue using. It is completely free to continue using, as long as you register. 
Kevin personally uses Lightworks for smaller video projects and Adobe Premiere Pro for multiple larger video projects (especially if they require multiple tracks, effects, and quality+performance is very important) because renders can be queued.

Below are two great video links, with timestamps as well so you can easily look up the stuff you want with a video tutorial.

This is the initial screen, you can Create a new project.. in the top left
Frame rate you can set to auto, but sometimes its good to set it to 30 or 60fps because some video capture devices (like GPUs) like to have variable frame rate.
Create a video project. Set the name and framerate.

Import audio and video files in the LOG tab. Bottom left of LOG tab you'll see ""Local Files"" where you can select multiple files and import them.

Edit the video in the EDIT tab, drag your audio/video files onto the track. Slide the red vertical bar to adjust current video position, hit the DEL key to make a cut. Right-click any clips to remove/delete and change their audio speed.

Add video effects in the VFX tab by dragging your effect component onto the clip that you want to apply it on.

Add audio effects in the AUDIO tab, but it's the same deal as VFX. You can also set volume caps/thbresholds for each track in the top right. LR is the master audio, meaning changing LR will change the audio output of ALL tracks. Change the audio level of a track by sliding up/down the dotted line of an audio track. You can also fade-in/fade-out audio by dragging the top-left and top-right corners of audio tracks (but the fade period is measured in frames, not seconds).

Once complete, you can export your movie/project/sequence (it's technically called a sequence)."

Asked to Login? Here are Steps to Try
You generally should not need to login to Echo360, so if you are being asked to do so, try the following.
Do not use:
Internet Explorer, the old default web browser in Windows 8.1 and below. Microsoft is only do occasional security updates now for it.
Edge, the current default web browser in Windows 10. It has issues with Bb Learn and various other websites.
Access Echo360 through the Bb Learn course:
Login to https://learn.dcollege.net/ and logging in with your DrexelOne or DrexelConnect userid and password.
Click the course whose lectures you wish to view in Echo360, the ""echo360 Class Recordings"" link in the left navigation panel.
And click the ""echo360 Class Recordings for [YOUR COURSE]"" link near the top of the page.
Disable any & all privacy enhancing or script blocking or fingerprint fooling or ad blocking plug-ins, add-ons, extensions, or settings in your web browser.
Vist https://echo360.org (but do not login, though it's okay if you are in Bb Learn and you are auto-logged in to echo360) there, and that will make it easier to disable these by tapping the appropriate icons in your browser web address bar or upper right toolbar.
Firefox instructions:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop
Chrome has no built-in features that you should need to enable for this.
Add-ons or plug-ins or extensions can usually be clicked on when you visit the page to disable for just that website.
If you are using a work computer, and run into issues, the problem could very well be that your work computer is blocking web services and/or related applications need by Echo360 to work.
So if you run into issues on your work computer, try your personal computer.

Cannot Find One or More Recordings
For the “COURSES” section in Echo360, the “Default” order in the “Sort By” drop-down menu is odd.
Scroll down to the bottom of the Echo360 “COURSES” webpage for your Drexel CCI course.
Or if you change the “Sort By” drop-down menu to “Oldest,” you’ll see the one or more recordings that you are missing.
If you still cannot find a recording, contact the Drexel CCI iCommons HelpDesk at 215-895-2480 or ihelp@drexel.edu.
Audio Is Hard to Hear
Is the audio hard to hear in an Echo360 recording or live video stream? Then try the following:
Adjust the volume slider when playing an Echo360 recording or live video stream:

Adjust your computer's volume
For Macs or Apple computer or laptops: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203186
Ignore the recommendation to upgrade your Mac OS or macOS.

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems
Install Browser Extension
If you are having trouble hearing a professor due to low audio, or bad audio, one possible work-around solution to try is to download/install the Chrome web browser and install the ""Volume Master"" extension from the Chrome Web Store at the link below.
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/volume-master/jghecgabfgfdldnmbfkhmffcabddioke
We cannot find a similar link for Firefox as of yet. The above link has a good chance of working for other Chrome-based web browsers, such as the new Microsoft Edge and the Brave web browser, as well, which may be less resource intensive on your computer.
If none of the advice above helps, contact us using information at the bottom of this webpage you are reading this on.
No Audio or Video or Recording Feed Freezes or Stutters
No video or audio in Echo360? Or audio and video feed coming in and out? Try the following steps:
Step 1
Logout of Echo360 and Bb Learn.
Close your internet browser completely.
Reopen your internet browser.
Log back into your Bb Learn course shell at https://learn.dcollege.net .
Try to access the Echo360 recordings again in the ""Echo360 Class Recordings"" area.
Click the ""Echo360 Class Recordings for [YOUR COURSE]"" link within that area.
Do not watch or share audio or video in Bb Collaborate Ultra when using Echo360.
If this does not work, try next step.
Step 2
Close your internet browser completely, and try a different internet browser.
If this doesn't work, try next step.
Step 3
You may somehow be having the wrong email address (long form is needed rather than the short form) or the wrong password get sent to Echo360.
A password reset may fix this. Here's how.
Find your Drexel long form email address.
Usually, it is your full name, with a period between the first, middle initial, and last name, followed by @drexel.edu.
Example: michael.j.galloway@drexel.edu . (Your long-form email address will be different.)
Enter Bb Learn at https://learn.dcollege.net , and try to enter Echo360 again.
If no login screen appears, logout of Bb Learn, and visit the Echo360 website (link below).
https://echo360.org/directLogin
If an Echo360 login screen appears in either Bb Learn or the Echo360 website, move onto step 4.
When you get to the login screen, enter your long form email address.
Use your Bb Learn password as your password.
If that doesn't log you in, click ""Forgot your password""
If prompted, enter your long form email address.
Click ""Send Email.""
Log out of Bb Learn too (if logged in).Close all open internet browser windows and tabs.
Wait 30 seconds.
Open your internet browser.
Follow the instructions in the email after receiving it.
Logout of Echo360 (if in Echo360).
Login to Bb Learn, and try again.
CCI Technical Staff -- Reboot Echo360 Device and Check Classroom Microphone for Serious Technical Issues
CCI Technical Staff: For any serious issues, try rebooting the Echo360 device and making sure the classroom microphone is not muted using the instructions below.
echo360 -- Rebooting echo360 Devices in CCI Classrooms
NEEDS UPDATE - echo360 -- Muting the Microphone during a Recording or Broadcast
For live broadcasts, interrupt the class for the 30 seconds or one-minute it takes to restart the device and/or turn on the microphone.
Echo360 takes 10 minutes or so to fully reboot. The live video stream and recording will start immediately afterwards again, but there will be a 10 minute or so gap.
If that doesn't work, offer to set-up Bb Collaborate Ultra in the classroom.
See Bb Collaborate Ultra
Slow Computer Response or High CPU or GPU Load
If your computer is running really slow and/or has a high GPU or CPU or processing load, then try the following:
Shrink the size of one or more of the video windows for the Echo360 broadcast, and/or the size of the internet browser tab where the videos are playing.
You may be able to reduce the size of the video windows in the internet browser.
If that doesn't help. change your computer's display resolution to something much, much lower.
If that doesn't help, follow the instructions in the section above called ""No Audio or Video or Recording Feed Freezes or Stutters.""

Mono Sound Only or Sound from One Speaker or Headphone
If you have mono sound (sound coming from one speaker or side of your headphones) when listening to Echo360 recordings, check your computer's sound settings, and then contact ihelp@drexel.edu to let us know if the issue persists. The following are work-around solutions that should help until a permanent solution is found.
Work-around Solution for Mac Users
You can make mono sound go to both your left and right speakers or headphones on a Mac by doing the following:
Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac desktop display.
Click ""System Preferences.""
Click ""Accessibility.""
Check the box next to ""Play stereo audio as mono.""
Close the ""Accessibility"" window and you should now hear mono audio from both your left and right speakers or headphones.
Work-around Solution for Windows Users with Headphones
If you have headphones on a Windows PC (7, 8.1, 10), the following should make mono sound go to both your left and right headphones.
We currently don't have any solution for making the mono sound go to both speakers with a Windows PC, unfortunately.
Right-click the speaker icon in the lower-right of your Windows desktop display.
Click ""Playback devices.""
Under the ""Playback"" tab, right-click your sound output device, and then click ""Properties.""
Click the ""Enhancements"" tab.
Scroll down and check ""Headphone Virtualization.""
Click ""OK.""
Static Occasionally in Audio
Some users on some computers may hear occasional static. We're trying to figure out why this is happening still.
We do have a proposed work-around solution if the issue is that static occasionally comes from one speaker or side of your headphones, but no other sound is heard from that side.
WARNING: You won't be able to use the work-around solutions for mono sound above with the work-around solution below, however.
Work-around Solution for Mac Users
The following should prevent the right or left speaker or headphone from making any noise at all on a Mac.
Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac desktop display.
Click ""System Preferences.""
Click ""Sound.""
Click ""Output"" so that it is highlighted.
Click your ""device for sound output.""
Move the slider in the ""Balance"" area either all the way to the left or right.
You will want to move away from the speaker or headphone side that is making no sound except occasional static.
Close the ""Sound"" window.
Work-around Solution for Windows Users
If you have headphones on a Windows PC (7, 8.1, 10), the following should prevent the right or left speaker or headphone from making any noise at all.
Right-click the speaker icon in the lower-right of your Windows desktop display.
Click ""Playback devices.""
Under the ""Playback"" tab, right-click your sound output device, and then click ""Properties.""
Click the ""Levels"" tab.
Click ""Balance""
Bring either the ""L"" or ""R"" speaker level all the way down to 0.
You will want to do this for whichever speaker makes no sound at all except for occasional static.
Click ""OK.""
Click ""OK.""
Click ""OK."""

Zoom -- Using Registration for Public Zoom Meetings
Introduction
If you are hosting an event that is open to the public,
using the Zoom Registration feature can be of great assistance.
You want people to sign up or ""register"" to know who is attending.
You can generate an RSVP list for who is attending the event.
And lets you only share the Zoom link with those who registered.
Registration for small meetings or classroom use is probably more work than it's worth.
We highly recommend the following for *ALL* Drexel Zoom meetings.
Zoom -- Managing Users, Privacy, and Security Measures
For any Zoom Meetings whose links are listed on a public website or that will have a large audience,
we also HIGHLY RECOMMEND the following
to keep the meeting secure and free of Zoom bombing ( Zoombombing ).
Zoom Virtual Walk-In Meetings or Public Links
Instructions
Here are 9 steps on how to use the Zoom Registration feature.
Login to Zoom at https://drexel.zoom.us

Troubleshooting Remote Desktop
NEEDS REVISION!!!!!!!!!!!

Basic Items to Cover First
If the user is off-campus, are they connected (for sure) to Drexel's VPN?
Let the user know we may need to sign them out or reboot the computer.
(a) LAST RESORT DURING COVID-19 Quarantine
(b) May not be able to login them back in.
Login as Administrator on the computer that they are connecting to.
(a) If the computer is not on, that's a problem.
Make sure the computer has an internet connection.
(a) Open Edge or a web browser. Browse to some random news story or website. Don't just check that there's an internet signal.
Is ""Allow remote connections to this computer"" enabled?
(a) Click Start. Search for ""Control Panel"" (no quotes). Search for ""remote desktop"" (no quotes) in the ""Control Panel"" window. Click ""Allow remote access"". In the ""System Properties"" window, be sure that ""Allow remote connections to this computer"" is selected and not grayed out.
(b) Make sure the checkbox that only allows uses with Network Level Authentication is checked.
Is the user in the list of allowed remote desktop users.
(a) If the ""System Properties"" window is not still open, follow instructions for 4.1 again.
(b) Click ""Select Users.""
(c) Make sure the user's userid appears as an allowed user for remote desktoping, along mjg88 and bjb344 and jpm46 and icommonscrc, and such.
Check that the user has the correct IP address.
(a) Click Start, type in ""cmd"" (without quotes), type in at the command line prompt in the cmd.exe/terminal window:
(b) ipconfig /all
(c) Press Enter/Return.
(d) In the Ethernet section, look for the IPv4 address.
(e) Make sure the user is using the same one.
If you or the users sees a ""Remote Desktop Connection"" error window appear that says:
""An authentication error has occurred.

The function requested is not supported.

Remote computer: ccisccm
This could be due to CredSSP encryption oracle remediation.
For more information, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866660 ""

Solution: RECOMMEND downloading Microsoft Remote Desktop app from Microsoft Store, which is built into all Windows 10 instances. Look in the Start menu under ""M"" or search for ""Microsoft Store,"" then search the Microsoft Store for ""Microsoft Remote Desktop.""
Their version of Microsoft Remote Desktop is old and incompatible.
Microsoft Account Authentication
If the login prompt shows ""MicrosoftAccount/userid"", instead of using the userid or ""DREXEL/userid"", you can use your DREXEL/userid when entering the password. However, make sure that you have the latest version of Microsoft Remote Desktop application available on the Windows Store or Microsoft.
If you are asked to sign in on the store, cancel or decline, but you will still need to download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app"

The blue line on the video timeline is the play head.
If you play the video, the video starts playing from here.
The ""Set In"" left bracket icon sets the new start time in the video.
Everything before it gets marked to be deleted.

The ""Set Out"" right bracket icon sets the new end time in the video.
Everything after it gets marked to be deleted. Click in the video where you want

Move the playhead blue line to where you want to cut.

The ""Split"" or cut scissors icon makes a segment in the video.
USE THIS OPTION TO REMOVE STUFF IN THE MIDDLE.

If you ""Split"" a segment in the middle,
you can use the ""Delete"" trash can icon to remove it.

Even Mike Galloway can't figure out how to use the Fade In/Out line segment icon for any desirable use.
But that's what that is.

Use the Undo or Redo curly arrows to undo or redo changes.
You can ""Reset"" or revert all changes with the  icon.

Want more precise movements with the blue line play head?
Move the ""Timeline Zoom"" slider right.
   
When finished:
Click ""Save"" to save your changes to the original.
Or click ""Save a Copy"" to make a copy.
Then click the Exit curved arrow icon to go back to the normal view of the video or media.

Handbrake -- Smaller Video File Size or Converting Video
Handbrake is a free and open-source program that reduces the file size of videos, but keeps the overall video and audio quality.
It's technically video transcoder, letting you convert video formats and other options and such, but reducing video file sizes is what many, many people use it for.
Download it from here:
https://handbrake.fr/
Once installed, click ""Open Source,"" locate the movie file and select it, click ""Add to Queue,"" and ""Start Queue.""
The bottom of the Handbrake window, between the ""Save As"" and the file name, and the ""Browse"" button, will tell you where the outputted smaller file will end up.
A notification will appear when finished to ""Put down that cockatil..."", and the converted video file will be ready, and will be a smaller file size.
If you don't like the result, click the ""Preset"" menu > ""General"" > ""HQ1080p30 Surround,"" and then do the above instructions again. Rename the old or new (""Save As"") converted movie file, or click to replace the converted movie file when prompted. This will make a smaller video file than your original still, but not quite as small as you first attempt, but with a better picture quality and audio quality."

OBS Studio
Introduction
OBS stands for Open Broadcaster Project. ""OBS Studio"" is a screen recorder that anyone can download and use on Windows, Mac, or Linux. With it, you can record video of anything on your computer display's desktop, record audio from a built-in or connected microphone, and record video from a built-in or connected webcam.
There is no time limit on recordings, but the longer and more involved the recording, the more storage space the recording will take up on your computer or wherever you choose to store it.
The user interface is a little different from what you may expect.
Installation
Install ""OBS Studio"" from the webpage below.
https://obsproject.com/
Works on Windows, Macs, and Linux computers.
May require download and installation of some DirectX software from Microsoft on a PC.
You should be taken through what to do to download and install the DirectX software, if necessary.

Record Zoom Breakout Rooms
Introduction
There is a known ""issue"" with Zoom where it may not seem ""possible"" to record meetings in a breakout room.
However, there's a workaround solution in order to allow participants to record in their own breakout rooms.
Here's the instructions and steps on being able to do this.
Allowing Recordings in Zoom Breakout Rooms
You can allow recording in breakout rooms by elevating the participant's permission in the break out room
by joining the breakout room, then going to the ""participants"" panel.
(You need to be the host or the co-host in order to do this)

After you enter the breakout room, press ""More"" to elevate the Participant's permission.
No matter the access level, you are required to join the breakout room to ""elevate"" the participant's permission to begin with. 

This is a roundabout way of allowing the participant to record,
but this is a simple way of allowing breakout rooms to record.
Additionally, you can also record in the main room and the breakout room concurrently,
and can be saved to the device or cloud. For better-ways to save the files, you can upload the recordings to
OneDrive at https://onedrive.com ,
or Kaltura Drexel Streams at https://drexel.edu/it/streams
Recordings can be shared as ""Unlisted"" videos. 

It is always a good suggestion to initiate the recording process with separate people,
and can either be cloud or local for saving the video.
To find the recordings, you can get the locations from this link:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206277393-Finding-and-viewing-local-recordings."
https://support.cci.drexel.edu/remote-conferencing-and-class-capture/teams/joining-teams-2nd-device/,Joining Teams from 2nd Device,"Contact The CCI Helpdesk
Joining Teams from 2nd Device
Join the meeting on your primary device (the one you will be speaking with and listening in the meeting on).

Join the meeting on your secondary device signed in under the same account. When asked, make sure to click ""Add this device"".

On your secondary device, begin screen sharing.


Now you should be able to listen to the meeting on your primary device while screen sharing your second device.

If only Drexel students, staff, instructors, adjuncts, or faculty are attending or speaking:
a. Keep checked “Only authenticated users can join” if you wish.
b. Everyone will still have to enter the password you set above.
c. But now they must also first authenticate by logging into to Drexel Connect in order to attend the Zoom meeting.
d. If anyone is already signed in through their Zoom application to their Drexel account, they will only be asked to enter the password you set above.
e. Works in web client too.
Copy the link, or click “Copy the invitation” & copy the meeting info.
a. Share that meeting information with others via email or where and how you wish.
You may also want to include this link, which tells people how to stay in through their Drexel Zoom application to their Drexel account, making it easier to enter meetings where only authenticated Drexel Zoom users are allowed, but they will also have to enter the password you set above.

Set-up a Free Zoom Account
Drexel CCI faculty, staff, and students should *NOT* use a free Drexel account. INSTEAD, they should use the Drexel Pro Zoom accounts at https://drexel.zoom.us .
Non-Drexel people do NOT need to sign in to join a Zoom meeting usually.
They just need a Zoom meeting link or ID, and to click ""Join"" on the Drexel Zoom or regular Zoom home page, and enter the info there.
Visit https://zoom.us
Click “SIGN UP FREE.”
Follow the onscreen instructions to create a free Zoom account.
Login to Zoom if necessary.
Click “HOST A MEETING.”
Click “With Video On” or “With Video Off” (your choice).
Follow the on-screen instructions to host a meeting with no else there to test out Zoom.
You then will likely be taken through how to download and install Zoom on your computer.
If necessary, open the downloaded application to install it.
Enter a name and email before joining the meeting.
Once in the meeting, click “Join Audio Conference by Computer.”
Look for color in the microphone to change as you speak.
That will let you know it's working.
If you have audio problems,
dial-in by telephone using the information below.

Click “Save” to schedule the meeting.
Pre-Meeting -- If Email Does Not Work to Add Someone as a Co-Host
If the short form email doesn't work, and it is a Drexel person, you need their long-form email address.
Everyone at Drexel has a short and long email address.

One way to get the Drexel long form email address
is to look up the other person in the Drexel Directory at

and look on their “Profile” page for what their “Sign-In Email” is,
and send that email address to you (the Host).
A final way is to email Mike Galloway & give him 1-2 business days.
Provide him with the Drexel userid (not student or employee ID #'s) and full name.
Only short or long form Drexel emails are needed for Drexel people.
Non-Drexel people should provide the email address associated with their Zoom account.

Your Zoom Videos Are Probably in Kaltura Already
Kaltura is the preferred option with your Bb Learn course section to add videos.
For a 1-3 hour recording, it usually takes 3-6 hours for videos to appear in Kaltura after Zoom recording stops. Rare occasions up to 24 hours.
The shorter the recording, the less time it takes.
After that, Zoom recordings, using the record to cloud option in Zoom, are ready to add to your Bb Learn course section via the Kaltura tool.
Simple Instructions
Make sure the Zoom application or program on your computer is signed into your Drexel account.
Login to https://drexel.zoom.us (NOT https://zoom.us)
See: Zoom -- SSO Single Sign-On and Host Sign-In to MAKE SURE YOU ARE SIGNED INTO YOUR DREXEL ACCOUNT.
Record a Zoom meeting using the record to cloud option.
Or use Zoom to make a pre-recorded lecture or presentation.
See: Zoom -- Recording
Wait a few hours for recordings to appear.
1-5 minute TEST recordings will be up MUCH faster
The Zoom meeting has to be over.
Go to your Bb Learn course section.
Enter a ""Week"" or other content area.
Click ""Build Content"" > ""Kaltura Media.""

echo360 -- Stats and Analytics
Live Video Streaming Stats
Tracking attendance for an echo360 live video stream is not very well developed yet, unfortunately.
The best method to track live video streaming attendance in echo360 during class is to have students use the Q&A feature to acknowledge that they are present.
And it's recommended that ask students to type in present as a new question, ideally for that class, just after the start of class and once more when you take a break or another time during the class.
Currently, there is no requirement that online remote students in cross listed online, and on-campus (F2F) classes attend the live video stream.
The webpage below will tell you how to use Q&A in echo360.
 echo360 -- Q and A Feature
The analytics in echo360 help very little with tracking live video streaming attendance.
But what little is offered is covered in the Recording Stats section below.
Recording Stats
     1. Enter the echo360 area through Bb Learn.
     2. Click “ANALYTICS.”
      
     3. Click “Students.”
     4. Click “All Classes.”
     5. Choose a class.
     6. Look at the “Attendance” and “Video Views” and “% Viewed” for each student.
          (a) Attendance: Only “Attendance” has any relevance to the live video stream, and the “Attendance” feature does not do much. The “Attendance” feature merely tracks if a student entered an echo360 live video stream for a class (really, the echo360 area for that class) at any time from between 10 minutes before the start of class and 5 minutes before the end of class.
But a student could simply enter and then leave during this time, and they would be marked as having attended class.
          (a) Video Views: “Video Views” will tell you if a student watched at least 5% of a video, and then count that as 1 view, but this is only for recordings, and not for live video streams, which is not tracked at all by this value.
Live broadcast stats will not appear as views in echo360 stats.
          (b) % Viewed: ""% Viewed” will tell you how much of the recording was watched by a student. But again, this is only for a recording, and not for a live video stream.

Mapmaker - Tiles
Introduction
Tiles are placed in your space/room to define private areas, spawn, portals to other locations, and impassible areas.
What are Tiles?
In general, a tile is one square of the grid on which you build your maps for your Gather Space. When you are inside of a Space, a single, quick press of your arrow keys will move your avatar one tile in the direction of the arrow key you pressed. 
All tile squares in Gather are 32 x32 pixels in size.
In the Mapmaker, you can have special tile types that are used to create specific effects. Each type of tile provides a different function for your Gather space. 
You can find and place the special Tile Types in the Mapmaker by selecting the Tile tab or pressing the hotkey [t].

The default Tile Type is ""Impassible Tile"" which is represented by an X. In the above image, the ""Spawn Tile"" type is selected and the icon in the upper left has changed to the corresponding matching map pin image. 
You can only add or delete the tile type you have selected. This helps you edit the different layers of tiles you have placed rather than accidentally deleting an Impassible Tile when you only wanted to delete the Private Space Tile in the same location.
Spawn Tiles
Spawn tiles are used by the mapmaker/host to designate where new attendees spawn in your event space! These spawn tiles can be placed directly near the entrance door of your space if you have guiding materials in your space for new users. They can also be placed throughout the room if you'd like users to enter in a specific area of your entrance.
Spawn Tiles are designated by these green highlighted tiles in the Mapmaker:

For larger conferences, you are welcome to create multiple spawn areas within your entrance room so that users spawn randomly and spread out in the space:

Changing your Spawn Default Entrance Room
Currently every room requires at least one spawn tile, just in case you decide to change the default entrance room. To change your default entrance room, you can right click on the room name in the top left room list and click set as default room.

Portal Tiles
Portal tiles are used by the mapmaker/host to connect various rooms within your space, as well as connecting separate Gather spaces together. 
Please note that portal tiles are ONE-WAY only, so you will need to place portal tiles from both sides of the origin room as well as the destination room.
When you select the portal tile option, you will be able to place a blue highlighted tile and the following two prompts will show up.

""Portal to a room"" will allow you to place portals in the same room or a different room within the same space you are currently working in. When you select this option, you will see a drop-down list of all rooms in the current space. Select the designated room you'd like to connect, then place the portal tile in the destination room. Please remember to then switch to the destination room and place another portal tile linking back to the original room.  The best practice is to place portals at the back end of a doorway, as indicated, and the exit destination as in front of the doorway.


Private Tiles
Private tiles are areas in the map where users in the private areas can only see each other, no matter how far they are with no video/audio fading.
Only other users in the same private area can see or hear you."

Drexel long-form email addresses go to the same email inbox as Drexel short-form or abc123 or userid email addresses.

but it’s almost always best to use the long-form email addresses first,
and then try the short-form email.

Asked to Login? Here are Steps to Try
You generally should not need to login to Echo360, so if you are being asked to do so, try the following.
Do not use:
Internet Explorer, the old default web browser in Windows 8.1 and below. Microsoft is only do occasional security updates now for it.
Edge, the current default web browser in Windows 10. It has issues with Bb Learn and various other websites.
Access Echo360 through the Bb Learn course:
Login to https://learn.dcollege.net/ and logging in with your DrexelOne or DrexelConnect userid and password.
Click the course whose lectures you wish to view in Echo360, the ""echo360 Class Recordings"" link in the left navigation panel.
And click the ""echo360 Class Recordings for [YOUR COURSE]"" link near the top of the page.
Disable any & all privacy enhancing or script blocking or fingerprint fooling or ad blocking plug-ins, add-ons, extensions, or settings in your web browser.
Vist https://echo360.org (but do not login, though it's okay if you are in Bb Learn and you are auto-logged in to echo360) there, and that will make it easier to disable these by tapping the appropriate icons in your browser web address bar or upper right toolbar.
Firefox instructions:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop
Chrome has no built-in features that you should need to enable for this.
Add-ons or plug-ins or extensions can usually be clicked on when you visit the page to disable for just that website.
If you are using a work computer, and run into issues, the problem could very well be that your work computer is blocking web services and/or related applications need by Echo360 to work.
So if you run into issues on your work computer, try your personal computer.

Cannot Find One or More Recordings
For the “COURSES” section in Echo360, the “Default” order in the “Sort By” drop-down menu is odd.
Scroll down to the bottom of the Echo360 “COURSES” webpage for your Drexel CCI course.
Or if you change the “Sort By” drop-down menu to “Oldest,” you’ll see the one or more recordings that you are missing.
If you still cannot find a recording, contact the Drexel CCI iCommons HelpDesk at 215-895-2480 or ihelp@drexel.edu.
Audio Is Hard to Hear
Is the audio hard to hear in an Echo360 recording or live video stream? Then try the following:
Adjust the volume slider when playing an Echo360 recording or live video stream:

Adjust your computer's volume
For Macs or Apple computer or laptops: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203186
Ignore the recommendation to upgrade your Mac OS or macOS.
For Windows computers: http://www.thewindowsclub.com/adjust-volume-for-individual-programs-windows
In particular check out the ""Volume Mixer"" section, but the whole webpage has lots of good suggestions for adjusting sound.
If the above webpage for Windows does not help, see the following webpage.

If none of the advice above helps, contact us using information at the bottom of this webpage you are reading this on.
No Audio or Video or Recording Feed Freezes or Stutters
No video or audio in Echo360? Or audio and video feed coming in and out? Try the following steps:
Step 1
Logout of Echo360 and Bb Learn.
Close your internet browser completely.
Reopen your internet browser.
Log back into your Bb Learn course shell at https://learn.dcollege.net .
Try to access the Echo360 recordings again in the ""Echo360 Class Recordings"" area.
Click the ""Echo360 Class Recordings for [YOUR COURSE]"" link within that area.
Do not watch or share audio or video in Bb Collaborate Ultra when using Echo360.
If this does not work, try next step.
Step 2
Close your internet browser completely, and try a different internet browser.
If this doesn't work, try next step.
Step 3
You may somehow be having the wrong email address (long form is needed rather than the short form) or the wrong password get sent to Echo360.
A password reset may fix this. Here's how.
Find your Drexel long form email address.
Usually, it is your full name, with a period between the first, middle initial, and last name, followed by @drexel.edu.
Example: michael.j.galloway@drexel.edu . (Your long-form email address will be different.)
Enter Bb Learn at https://learn.dcollege.net , and try to enter Echo360 again.
If no login screen appears, logout of Bb Learn, and visit the Echo360 website (link below).
https://echo360.org/directLogin
If an Echo360 login screen appears in either Bb Learn or the Echo360 website, move onto step 4.
When you get to the login screen, enter your long form email address.
Use your Bb Learn password as your password.
If that doesn't log you in, click ""Forgot your password""
If prompted, enter your long form email address.
Click ""Send Email.""
Log out of Bb Learn too (if logged in).Close all open internet browser windows and tabs.
Wait 30 seconds.
Open your internet browser.
Follow the instructions in the email after receiving it.
Logout of Echo360 (if in Echo360).
Login to Bb Learn, and try again.
CCI Technical Staff -- Reboot Echo360 Device and Check Classroom Microphone for Serious Technical Issues
CCI Technical Staff: For any serious issues, try rebooting the Echo360 device and making sure the classroom microphone is not muted using the instructions below.
echo360 -- Rebooting echo360 Devices in CCI Classrooms
NEEDS UPDATE - echo360 -- Muting the Microphone during a Recording or Broadcast
For live broadcasts, interrupt the class for the 30 seconds or one-minute it takes to restart the device and/or turn on the microphone.
Echo360 takes 10 minutes or so to fully reboot. The live video stream and recording will start immediately afterwards again, but there will be a 10 minute or so gap.
If that doesn't work, offer to set-up Bb Collaborate Ultra in the classroom.
See Bb Collaborate Ultra
Slow Computer Response or High CPU or GPU Load
If your computer is running really slow and/or has a high GPU or CPU or processing load, then try the following:
Shrink the size of one or more of the video windows for the Echo360 broadcast, and/or the size of the internet browser tab where the videos are playing.
You may be able to reduce the size of the video windows in the internet browser.
If that doesn't help. change your computer's display resolution to something much, much lower.
If that doesn't help, follow the instructions in the section above called ""No Audio or Video or Recording Feed Freezes or Stutters.""
This issue can happen on 4K monitors, especially if there are hardware compatibility issues.

Mono Sound Only or Sound from One Speaker or Headphone
If you have mono sound (sound coming from one speaker or side of your headphones) when listening to Echo360 recordings, check your computer's sound settings, and then contact ihelp@drexel.edu to let us know if the issue persists. The following are work-around solutions that should help until a permanent solution is found.
Work-around Solution for Mac Users
You can make mono sound go to both your left and right speakers or headphones on a Mac by doing the following:
Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac desktop display.
Click ""System Preferences.""
Click ""Accessibility.""
Check the box next to ""Play stereo audio as mono.""
Close the ""Accessibility"" window and you should now hear mono audio from both your left and right speakers or headphones.
Work-around Solution for Windows Users with Headphones
If you have headphones on a Windows PC (7, 8.1, 10), the following should make mono sound go to both your left and right headphones.
We currently don't have any solution for making the mono sound go to both speakers with a Windows PC, unfortunately.
Right-click the speaker icon in the lower-right of your Windows desktop display.
Click ""Playback devices.""
Under the ""Playback"" tab, right-click your sound output device, and then click ""Properties.""
Click the ""Enhancements"" tab.
Scroll down and check ""Headphone Virtualization.""
Click ""OK.""
Static Occasionally in Audio
Some users on some computers may hear occasional static. We're trying to figure out why this is happening still.
We do have a proposed work-around solution if the issue is that static occasionally comes from one speaker or side of your headphones, but no other sound is heard from that side.
WARNING: You won't be able to use the work-around solutions for mono sound above with the work-around solution below, however.
Work-around Solution for Mac Users
The following should prevent the right or left speaker or headphone from making any noise at all on a Mac.
Click the Apple icon in the upper left corner of your Mac desktop display.
Click ""System Preferences.""
Click ""Sound.""
Click ""Output"" so that it is highlighted.
Click your ""device for sound output.""
Move the slider in the ""Balance"" area either all the way to the left or right.
You will want to move away from the speaker or headphone side that is making no sound except occasional static.
Close the ""Sound"" window.
Work-around Solution for Windows Users
If you have headphones on a Windows PC (7, 8.1, 10), the following should prevent the right or left speaker or headphone from making any noise at all.
Right-click the speaker icon in the lower-right of your Windows desktop display.
Click ""Playback devices.""
Under the ""Playback"" tab, right-click your sound output device, and then click ""Properties.""
Click the ""Levels"" tab.
Click ""Balance""
Bring either the ""L"" or ""R"" speaker level all the way down to 0.
You will want to do this for whichever speaker makes no sound at all except for occasional static.
Click ""OK.""
Click ""OK.""
Click ""OK."""

Key Differences with Regular Zoom
Zoom HIPAA Private Mode is VERY similar to the normal Zoom Pro accounts that all Drexel faculty, instructors, staff, and students have.
Here are the differences:
End-to-end encryption, including encrypted chats
   •   A green lock with an E on it appears in upper left of Zoom meeting, indicating end-to-end encryption.
Removes device & user information in logs and reports.
Only records to the host's computer, not the cloud.
No live streaming to YouTube, Facebook, & Workplace on Facebook.
   •   You can live meetings with multiple people, but not to the general public.
Uses https://drexelprivate.zoom.us or drexelprivate.zoom.us 
   •   Rather than https://drexel.zoom.us or drexel.zoom.us
   •   This is how Zoom session links start.
   •   Also, SSO or Single-sign-on windows will ask you to fill in [ BLANK ].zoom.us
   •   Enter drexelprivate in front of .zoom.us for HIPAA Private Zoom meetings

Introduction
This would be good way of having students create their own little ""Zoom rooms"" at will that others could not enter.
And that an instructor does not have to create. 
(But instructors cannot audit or record the group work using this method, unless you ask students to share recordings and gather them, and that will be a lot of work for the instructor.)
One Student Quickly Schedules and Shares a Meeting
1 student in group does the following:
Log into Zoom via https://drexel.zoom.us 
Click Sign In Standard> Meetings > Schedule a Zoom meeting.
Make no changes.
Just click ""Save"" at bottom.
Then the student either...
Clicks ""Copy the Invitation"" > ""Copy Meeting Invitation.""
The pastes info into email & send email to 1 or more other students in group.
OR...
Gives the ""Meeting ID"" to the 2nd student (or other student group members)
who then visit https://zoom.us
or
https://drexel.zoom.us
Then click ""Join Meeting,"" 
How to Make Another Meeting Quickly
In first Zoom meeting,
click ""Leave Meeting"" > ""End Meeting (for All)"" or ""Leave Meeting"" (again).
Log into Zoom via https://drexel.zoom.us in a new web browser tab.

Unlisted is much better than any Published video option for this, generally.

Problems Uploading
Try again.
Sometimes Kaltura or Drexel Streams has flukes.
Also, close/re-open your web browser.

Quick Notes
Drexel Streams = Kaltura... mostly.
Drexel Streams and Kaltura are more or less the same.
The links below DO NOT SUBMIT videos to assignments or instructors. They are just good to know for this purpose, but there's more to submitting such assignments.
Drexel Streams is at:
https://drexel.edu/it/streams
or...
https://1513041.mediaspace.kaltura.com/
& has more features.
Kaltura is embedded in Bb Learn & lets you easily post in Bb Learn. Fewer features, though.
Same videos. Same backend service.
More on all of this below. 
Uploading Video, Audio, Media to Drexel Streams
It sometimes is easier or more helpful to upload a video you made to Drexel Streams directly, rather than through Bb Learn.

The links below DO NOT SUBMIT videos to assignments or instructors. 
They are just good to know for this purpose, but there's more to submitting such assignments.

Access Drexel Streams at:
https://drexel.edu/it/streams
or...
https://1513041.mediaspace.kaltura.com/
& login with Drexel userid/password.

Click +ADD NEW > Media Upload > agree to the terms, if prompted > and then ""Choose a file to upload. Follow on-screen instructions.

Again, this DOES NOT SUBMIT videos to assignments or instructors. 

It just helps towards that end.
Finding Uploaded Video, Audio, Media in Drexel Streams
It can be easier to search Drexel Streams for videos you uploaded via Kaltura to Bb Learn, rather than in Bb Learn..
Or you are in Drexel Streams and want to find a video, so here's how.

Go to Drexel Streams at:
https://drexel.edu/it/streams
or...

Zoom not working and Troubleshooting
Basic Troubleshooting
Make sure webcam is not covered.
Uninstall Zoom completely from the computer Zoom isn't working on.
How to uninstall in Windows 10.
Download & install Zoom again.
Use the SSO or Single-sign on option to sign in.
Screenshare Shortcut Key
If someone cannot figure out how to screenshare, especially if you are trying to assist them, tell them to use the following shortcut key combination
Alt + S
Tell them to press and hold the Alt key. And then keep the Alt key held down, while they tap the S key once. Repeat these instructions slowy for a non-tech savvy user.
This shortcut allows the user to screen-share without having to find the share button
Echoes and Sound Artifacts
If possible, use a headset with a microphone, or AirPods or very good alternatives.
NO cheap bluetooth headphones with mics!
Your own external speakers play audio that the microphone picks up.
And others in the meeting could have the same thing going on.
It's a lot for echo cancellation to handle at times.
AirPods or headsets reduce what microphones pick-up, except for your own voice.
Everyone in the same physical room as the host user
should *mute their computer microphones and computer speaker volume.*

The host user is the exception.
The host user should NOT mute their computer microphone and computer speakers...
UNLESS the host use is using a phone or speakerphone for audio.
Then the host indeed should mute their computer microphone & computer speakers.
Zoom Lags or Freezes or Audio is Delayed
Try one or more of these suggestions.
All hosts, presenters, panelists, or participants:
mute your audio if you are not speaking much.
All hosts, presenters, panelists, or participants:
turn off your video, unless truly needed.
Instructors or others requiring video to appear may need to be flexible on that requirement.
If someone is screen sharing, have that person stop,
and adjust the resolution on their computer to 1920 x 1080p (or i) or below.
Then re-share screen.
Any scaling you choose is fine.
Close any open applications or browser tabs or windows not needed for the meeting.
Closing non-essential apps in the lower right (System Tray) in Windows,
or upper right (Menu Bar) in Mac, if you can.
Click the ^ in Windows (lower right) and right-click.
Close any messaging apps, Adobe apps, Microsoft apps not needed for this meeting.
Leave the Zoom meeting.
Update the Zoom app installed on your computer.
Re-enter the meeting.
Try updating Zoom. See link below.
Zoom Updating or Updates
Participants on their own personal WiFi network

Invalid Meeting ID or Invalid Meeting Number Error
Zoom -- Invalid Meeting ID or Invalid Meeting Number
Zoom Crashes
Try one or more of these suggestions.
See what we suggest in the Zoom Lags or Freezes or Audio is Delayed section above.
If you are using another application, and Zoom is crashing:
uninstall/reinstall that application.
Use with OneNote has been an issue at times. Close OneNote.
Close and use less than 8 tabs in whatever web browser you have. 
Removing unknown or unused add-ons and extensions and clearing cache/history can help.
Link below has instructions.
Clear Browser Cache & History.
Do not use ""Gallery"" mode. It is resource intensive.
More info:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362323-Changing-the-video-layout-Active-Speaker-View-and-Gallery-View-
Uninstall & reinstall Zoom.
Reboot your device.
In the Zoom app, go to
Settings > Video Settings > Advanced.
Under ""Use hardware acceleration for"", uncheck ALL option.
If you still have problems after trying all the above,
try to change ""Video Rendering Method"" to ""Direct3D11.""
You may also want to Google this:
Best Zoom Video Rendering Method
and include the make, model, and/or OS of your computer in the search phrase.
If the above does not help, doing a more thorough update of drives, BIOS,
and such can help in Windows.
See link below.

QuickTime -- Converting Other Media
Here is how you can use QuickTime to convert other audio, video, or media to another format by screen recording it while it plays on your Mac.
To prevent unwanted audio during the recording, if you have two 3.5 mm audio ports, one for ""headphones"" (""lineout"") and one for ""microphone"" (""mic"" or ""linein""), find a 3.5 mm cord with a male plug at both ends, and plug the cord (or plug the plug) into the ""headphone"" and then the ""microphone"" ports or jacks on your computer. Make sure your screen recorder is not set to pick up computer audio. Then play the video and see if the screen recorder is picking up audio. Then do a test recording to see how it sounds.
If you don't have a ""lineout"" and ""linein"" 3.5 mm audio port on your computer, you can find USB-to-3.5 mm adapters (converters) on Amazon for less than $10 that have .
Here are example images of a 3.5 mm cord with a male plug at both ends.

 -by-step instructions for making such a screen recording using QuickTime on a Mac are below.
Review the webpage below for how to screen record with ""QuickTime.""
QuickTime -- Screen Recording Instructions
Open the video, audio, or other media on your Mac. Expand the window with this media and the contents of the window as large as possible without losing any wanted visuals.
Click the green circle in upper left of a window to expand it so that it takes up the entire display.
To return to the window to normal size, move your mouse pointer to the top of the computer display, and take your hands off your Mac's touch pad or mouse for 2-3 seconds. You'll see the top of the window appear, and then you can click the green circle again.
You can keep a window maximized but switch between another Window in recent Mac OS or macOS by placing 3 fingers on the touch pad and swiping left on the touchpad. Swipe 3 fingers right to go back to the maximized window.
Switch between applications using the keyboard:
Press and hold the ⌘ key (also known as ""command"" or ""cmd""), and then press ""tab"" once while holding the ⌘ key down.
The ""Application Switcher"" window appears.
While holding the ⌘ key, press the ""tab"" key one or more times to select an application to the right.
While holding the ⌘ key, press the ` key one or more times to select an application to the left.
Switch between multiple open windows for the same application, like an internet browser.
Press and hold the ⌘ key (also known as ""command"" or ""cmd""), and then press ' one or more times while holding the ⌘ key down to select the desired window.
Open up the QuickTime application on your Mac.
If you switch to a different application on your Mac then QuickTime, you'll likely have to open QuickTime again.
When QuickTime is open, if you right-click the QuickTime icon in the ""Dock"" or set of icons at the bottom of the Mac computer display, select ""Options,"" and select ""Keep in Dock,"" you can more easily access ""QuickTime.""
If a pop-up window for selecting files appears, click ""Done"" in lower right.
Click ""File"" and then ""New Screen Recording.""
Set the microphone in ""QuickTime"" to be ""Line In.""

Make sure the volume slider line is slid all the way to the left.

Set your Mac computer's volume to be about 75-80% of maximum.
Click the apple icon in upper left of computer display, select ""System Preferences,"" click ""Sound,"" click ""Output,"" and move the slider accordingly.
Or click the speaker icon (if available) in upper right of computer display, and move the slider accordingly.
 Find a 3.5 mm cord with a male plug at both ends, and plug the cord (or plug the plug) into the ""headphone"" and then the ""microphone"" ports or jacks on your computer.
Switch to the window with the media and start playing the media or running the media presentation.
Switch back to the QuickTime window, and check that audio level indicator is moving (meaning that audio is being picked up).
You usually want twice as many white bars appearing on average as shown in the following image.

Switch to the window with the media, stop playing the media, and set the media back to the beginning.
Check how long the media will play for.
Start the recording.
You may want to just do a test recording for 10-20 seconds first, and see what you get. Then discard the test recording.
Switch to the window with the media and start playing the media from the start.
Move your mouse cursor to the far left or right, and as far out of sight as possible.
Don't move it down or up.
Set a timer (most mobile devices have them built-in to clock applications with timers) for the length of the recording.
Wait for the media to play through, and don't do anything else on the computer playing the media.
When the timer expires, check that the media has finished playing, and stop the screen recording.
In ""QuickTime,"" use the ""Trim"" feature under ""Edit"" and then ""Trim"" to remove unwanted video from the start and end of the recording.
Start at the right side, and move the right end of the yellow box right to set where the video will end.
Note that if you move the slider, and then stop moving the slider without releasing it, QuickTime will ""zoom in"" so that you can move the slider over much shorter time intervals more easily.
Move the left end of the yellow box left to set where the video will start.
If you start on the left, then do the right side, you often have to redo the left side again.
Note that if you move the slider, and then stop moving the slider without releasing it, QuickTime will ""zoom in"" so that you can move the slider over much shorter time intervals more easily.
You can play the video within the yellow box to see what is still included and click different points in the movie timeline.
Click ""Trim"" when finished editing start and end of the video.
Save the video where you want with what name you want on your Mac."

You can add anyone to a Team in Microsoft Teams as an owner, member, or guests. Guests are external to the Drexel organization (not students, not employees, not faculty, not paid researchers). No one can have access to a channel in a Team in Microsoft Teams if they are not a member, guest, or owner for that Team. However, you can use Private Channels if you want select members and guests of that Team to see that channel and its contents.
Creating Standard vs Private Channels.
Private channels have select members or guests only with access to that channel, rather than everyone in the team, like a Standard Channel.

echo360 -- Sharing an Individual Class Recording -- for Instructors
Introduction
Some instructors choose to have their classes recorded in echo360 but to have these recordings be unavailable to students by default.
This webpage explains how an instructor can share the recording of a particular lecture or class with one student or a select number of students when the recordings for this class are unavailable to students by default.
Students will access these recordings at the https://echo360.org website, outside of Bb Learn.
*INSTRUCTORS: It is your responsibility to inform students if your class is being recorded but that these recordings are unavailable.*
You will be contacted multiple times before the start of a quarter if your class is going to be recorded.
We HIGHLY RECOMMEND obtaining department head, assistant department head, or program director approval before sharing class recordings with anyone who wasn't enrolled as an instructor, course assistant, or student in the class.

Zoom is setting a “Playback Range” of the original recording, not modifying it.
So if the Zoom recording is downloaded,
the downloaded recording will still be the original length,
regardless of the playback range you set.
But, of course, you can edit the downloaded video file.
Note: Zoom has a loophole where students can still view the full-length videos, even in Zoom:
“Note: Playback range will not apply to users viewing cloud recordings on Internet Explorer, Safari, or on mobile devices,
if they view the recording using low bandwidth mode.”
This is unfortunate,
but there is a good chance that few if any students will see the full version.
See 3rd paragraph under
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003001383-Cloud-recording-playback
Keeping Edits
If you trim the video in Kaltura or Drexel Streams, or another actual video editor,
the edits remain, even if downloaded (or played or shared).
Check Kaltura or Drexel Streams, and the “Zoom Recordings” folder in OneDrive,
but there’s a good chance that your edits in Zoom don’t carry over.
See Edit Video or Video Settings in Kaltura Drexel Streams
One useful thing to do here might be to take some screenshots of these Zoom video recording’s “Playback Range.”
See step 3 & screenshot there at link below:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003001383-Cloud-recording-playback
Save these screenshots in a folder with course number or title
in hidden-to-students folder in Bb Learn
(or OneDrive or where you will, and named what you will).
Then when you post Kaltura videos in Bb Learn of these Zoom recordings,
just find the vidoes in Drexel Streams at https://learn.dcolleget.net ,
and do the quick and lite video editing & trimming
using the time stamps shown in the “Playback Range” screenshots."

Everyone else, or If you a Safari user and still have issues, disable your pop-up blocker for Bb Learn. Instructions are below.
Set your internet browser to allow pop-up tab/windows for Bb Learn (or all websites with Safari). Here's how to do this in all the major internet browsers (in no particular order).
Firefox pop-up disabling
In Firefox, the blocked pop-up message will look like the example screenshot below. Click the ""Preferences"" button shown in the upper-right corner of the example screenshot below. Then click ""Allow pop-ups for learn.dcollege.net.""

Internet Explorer pop-up disabling
In Internet Explorer 11, the blocked pop-up message will look like the example screenshot below. Click ""Options for this site."" Then click ""Always allow."" You may not need to do anything more for the Echo360.org website for your Bb Learn course to open in a new window, but if you do, proceed to step 4. 

Safari pop-up disabling
In Safari, you will not get a message that pop-ups are blocked. To allow pop-ups, click the ""Safari"" menu, click ""Preferences,"" click ""Security,"" uncheck ""Block pop-up windows,"" and close the ""Security"" window.
Please note that this will allow pop-ups on all websites you visit in Safari.
Safari unfortunately does not allow you to select specific websites where pop-ups are allowed, so you may wish to use a different internet browser if this is an issue for you.
Or, after you are finished with echo360, you can block pop-ups again. To block pop-ups again, click the ""Safari"" menu, click ""Preferences,"" click ""Security,"" check ""Block pop-up windows,"" and close the ""Security"" window.
Chrome pop-up disabling
In Chrome, the blocked pop-up message will look like the example screenshot below. Click on the pop-up blocked icon circled in the example screenshot below. Then select ""Always allow pop-ups from learn.dcollege.net"" and click ""Done."" 
Edge (NOT RECOMMENDED) pop-up disabling
Edge is not recommended for use with Bb Learn or echo360.
If you want to still try to use Edge, then in Edge, the blocked pop-up message will look like the example screenshot below. Click ""Always allow.""

If new tab/window opens (possibly with code on it), close the new tab/window.
Reload the Bb Learn webpage.
If reloading the Bb Learn webpage does not give you access to the echo360 recordings or live broadcast, follow the instructions below.
Click the house icon circled in the example screenshot below.

Repeat steps 1-2 above, and you should then have the echo360.org website for your Bb Learn course open in a new window.
Unless you have set your browser not to save your preferences, you should now only have to do steps 1-2 to access the echo360.org website through Bb Learn.
But look below for additional assistance if needed.

Zoom not working and Troubleshooting
Basic Troubleshooting
Make sure webcam is not covered.
Uninstall Zoom completely from the computer Zoom isn't working on.
How to uninstall in Windows 10.
Download & install Zoom again.
Use the SSO or Single-sign on option to sign in.
Screenshare Shortcut Key
If someone cannot figure out how to screenshare, especially if you are trying to assist them, tell them to use the following shortcut key combination
Alt + S
Tell them to press and hold the Alt key. And then keep the Alt key held down, while they tap the S key once. Repeat these instructions slowy for a non-tech savvy user.
This shortcut allows the user to screen-share without having to find the share button
Echoes and Sound Artifacts
If possible, use a headset with a microphone, or AirPods or very good alternatives.
NO cheap bluetooth headphones with mics!
Your own external speakers play audio that the microphone picks up.
And others in the meeting could have the same thing going on.
It's a lot for echo cancellation to handle at times.
AirPods or headsets reduce what microphones pick-up, except for your own voice.
Everyone in the same physical room as the host user
should *mute their computer microphones and computer speaker volume.*

The host user is the exception.
The host user should NOT mute their computer microphone and computer speakers...
UNLESS the host use is using a phone or speakerphone for audio.
Then the host indeed should mute their computer microphone & computer speakers.
Zoom Lags or Freezes or Audio is Delayed
Try one or more of these suggestions.
All hosts, presenters, panelists, or participants:
mute your audio if you are not speaking much.
All hosts, presenters, panelists, or participants:
turn off your video, unless truly needed.
Instructors or others requiring video to appear may need to be flexible on that requirement.
If someone is screen sharing, have that person stop,
and adjust the resolution on their computer to 1920 x 1080p (or i) or below.
Then re-share screen.
Any scaling you choose is fine.
Close any open applications or browser tabs or windows not needed for the meeting.
Closing non-essential apps in the lower right (System Tray) in Windows,
or upper right (Menu Bar) in Mac, if you can.
Click the ^ in Windows (lower right) and right-click.
Close any messaging apps, Adobe apps, Microsoft apps not needed for this meeting.
Leave the Zoom meeting.
Update the Zoom app installed on your computer.
Re-enter the meeting.
Try updating Zoom. See link below.

echo360 -- Rebooting echo360 Devices in CCI Classrooms
Here is how CCI iCommons or uCommons staff can reboot an echo360 SafeCapture HD device.
All CCI classrooms have an echo360 SafeCapture HD device in them or near them. This is the device that allows for recording, storing, and streaming video and audio feeds from CCI classrooms for events and class recordings.
These devices should be rebooted once a week, when nothing is being recorded.
Rebooting an echo360 device can also often technical issues with recordings or live broadcasts.
Echo360 takes 10 minutes or so to fully reboot. The live video stream and recording will start immediately afterwards again, but there will be a 10 minute or so gap.
To reboot an echo360 device, do the following.
     1. Grab the podium key.
          (a) Ask the co-op or John McNamara or another student assistant if you don't know where to find this key.
     2. Bring a cellphone with a flashlight option or a flashlight.
     3. Enter the CCI classroom, and open up the back of the podium with the key.For SC 326 (3401 Market Street), go instead to the small equipment room on the same floor and open up the small server rack.
          (a) Ask the co-op or John McNamara or another student assistant if you don't know where this room is.
     4. Find the echo360 device, turn the switch off on the back right of the device, wait 10 seconds, and turn the switch on again.
          (a) If you have trouble finding the echo360 device, look at the front of the podium for a device labeled echo360, then figure where that device would be located when viewed from behind.
           
     5. Lock up the podium. That's it."

Basically, when you are finished editing the video in Camtasia, and have added the quiz(zes) in Camtasia, and you go to Share > Local File > MP4 with Smart Player (up to 1080p) > Next > Report quiz results using SCORM (I left SCORM options on defaults, but feel free to experiment) and do not check “Report quiz results through email” > Next > choose “Folder” and rename if wish and check “Organize produced files into sub-folders” and “Show production results” but do not check “Play video after production (before upload)” > “Finish.”
Go into the newly created folder with your video on your computer, find the .zip file and note the location. Go to Bb Learn and one of your “Week” areas or a similar area with a “Build Content” button/menu and click Build Content > Content Package (SCORM) > Browse My Computer > find the folder with .zip file and select and upload it > Submit. Wait for upload, possibly a while with no visual indication of progress. Fill in options on form that appears. You do not need to make it gradeable. I recommend putting in the “Description” box or “Title” that this is a video with quiz and to click link to play. Then click Submit. New items appears at bottom of pages (unless no items on page). Play video.
Disable pop-up blocker if no video plays. Chrome or Firefox may work better than Safari. Edge and IE are not recommended.
If you don’t need the quizzes graded, I highly recommend making the quizzes in Kaltura directly, after uploading the video by itself into the Kaltura Drexel Streams tool in Bb Learn, or at https://drexel.edu/it/streams . There are more available functions in DrexelOne, FYI. You can distribute any videos uploaded in DrexelOne’s Kaltura to Bb Learn in much the same way as uploading directly to Bb Learn (just don’t create a new video, select from available)."

And we've personally tested:
Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, iPadOS, ChromeOS, and Amazon Fire OS.
All work fine. All support Zoom.
All could be used to provide a webcam in addition
You can be in a Zoom meeting with 2 devices at the same time.
BUT you should *ONLY CONNECT AUDIO ON ONE*.

ActivePresenter Screen Recorder
Introduction and Download
Introduction
""ActivePresenter"" is screen recording software that is free for personal and non-commercial use. (There are versions that cost money as well.) With it, you can record video of anything on your computer display's desktop, record audio from a built-in or connected microphone, and record video from a built-in or connected webcam.
There is no time limit on recordings, but the longer and more involved the recording, the more storage space the recording will take up on your computer or wherever you choose to store it.

Quick Instructions
You can just record yourself in a Zoom meeting your schedule.
Or you can record a meeting with others, if you are doing group work.
Do a 30-second test recording first.
Make sure your mic is picking up sound in the recording.
Make sure you screenshare if you need to demonstrate something on your computer.
Turn on your webcam in Zoom if you need to record yourself.
Below is how to enable/use the cloud/online recording option in Zoom.
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203741855-Cloud-recording
Record to the Cloud (Online) in Zoom
Personal Meeting Room recordings may NOT be automatically uploaded to Drexel Streams (Kaltura).
In that case, see the ""Download Recording in Zoom"" section below.
When you record a Zoom meeting, you have 2 options.
""Record to the computer""
""Record to the cloud""
We recommend ""Record to the Cloud.""
Drexel Zoom Pro recordings made to the cloud are backed up to Drexel Streams (Kaltura).
And the recordings are more easily accessible and less likely to be lost in the cloud.
We'll cover how to find/obtain either option here.
Do NOT edit recordings in Zoom.
They are not real edits.
When you download from Zoom, your unedited video will be downloaded, not your edited video.
Find Recordings in Zoom
Visit https://drexel.zoom.us in a web browser.
(Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, etc.)
Sign in on the Drexel Connect screen (if prompted).
Approve MFA if prompted.
Click ""Recordings"" in left nav.
If you recorded to your computer:
The Local Recordings tabs you what computer name and folder path to find where the recording was saved.
If you moved the recording on that computer later on, then this info may not be accurate.
If you're not sure of your computer's name, check each of the computer's you use.
If you record to the cloud:
The Cloud Recordings tab will list your recordings in the Zoom's cloud storage system.
Recordings to Cloud for Drexel Zoom are kept for 126 days in the Zoom cloud. Then deleted.
Recordings to Cloud for Drexel Zoom are also automatically backed up to Drexel Streams (Kaltura).
The Drexel Streams (Kaltura) copy remains indefinitely.

Notes
Downloading Drexel Streams or Kaltura video is NOT necessary, generally, if you record to cloud (except for Personal Meetings).
You can play Drexel Streams or Kaltura videos fine in your web browser.
If you are not the creator/owner of the video, downloading a video is complicated.
Downloading video is not necessary for submitting assignments, generally.
Few instructors need it. A few may want it, and will tell you that, but very, very, very few will actually need it.
Recordings cannot be downloaded from an embedded player window in Bb Learn.
Links to the video on the Drexel Streams website can allow downloads.

Papercut -- Cannot Print to Black & White or CCIBW or BW
Tagged with: papercut printing
When printing to the black and white queue on PaperCut, you may come across an error (similar but not exact results to the photo) where the page shows up as a glitched color page. Other glitches may also occur. This problem happens often in Chrome since it defaults the browser to print in color despite choosing to print in black and white. This issue can occur when trying to print to CCIBW - the PaperCut black and white printer.

In order to fix this error:
The web browser should have an option (most likely dropdown menu but others as well) to ask if you want to print in color or black and white.
Select to print in black and white for the black and white printer.
When printing black and white to the PaperCut black and white printers, CCIBW, double check that the web browser is set to print in black and white."

Printing and Copying with PaperCut Printers
Tagged with: papercut copy print
Printing from PaperCut is very similar to printing normally, but there are some minor differences. These instructions apply to Macs, PCs, iOS and Android devices, as well as Chrome OS systems.
The first difference you'll notice when printing is that you no longer have separate printers for the different copy rooms - now, the only printers you will see are the ""CCI Color"" and ""CCI BW"" printers. Instead of printing to a specific printer, you simply choose whether you want to print in black and white or in color. You can then walk to either printer and release your print job.

When printing from a Drexel Mac or PC, you can access advanced printing options just as you have in the past, for finishing options such as stapling and sorting.
After submitting a print job, you may be asked for your Drexel username and password. This will ensure that only you can print your documents when you get to the printer.

Once you've submitted your print job, and possibly authenticated with your Drexel credentials, you can go to either copy room to print your documents. Most faculty and staff have already been imported into the system and will be able to simply scan their DragonCard to log in, as shown below; you can also log in with your Drexel credentials if you don't have your card.

If your card is not recognized, you will be asked to log in using your Drexel credentials. This will record your card number so you can scan your card in the future.

Once logged into PaperCut, you can choose ""Print Release"" or ""Access Device"", as shown below:

To print things you have submitted to the queue, choose ""Print Release"". This will bring you to your personal print queue, where you can choose to print documents you have submitted to the print queue. You can also choose to print as grayscale or convert a print to two-sided printing if desired.

To use the copier as a copier or scanner, choose ""Access Device"". This will give you the copier's standard interface, as you may have used before.

Software:  FlashPrint http://www.flashforge.com/support-center/flashprint-support/

How to Print
First make a file to print by following these instructions: Creating The Print File
Once you have created a .gx file for the printer, transfer it to a USB stick.
Put that USB stick in the printer at the bottom right port.
On the printer screen, select Build -> USB Stick and navigate to the file.
After selecting the file, hit Print.
(NOT NECESSARY IF PRINTER CALIBRATED CORRECTLY.) Immediately after selecting print, take the glue stick and spread glue over the area that the object will be printing on (just guesstimate). Also, take tweezers and (quickly) pull off the excess plastic from the tip.
Now you should be good to let it print.
After Printing, the blue tray where the print site can be pulled out. Do that when you try to take the print off, if you used glue, use the scraper to get the object off the plate.
How to Change/Replace Filament
To unload the filament, go to Tools -> Filament
Select ""Unload"" and the extruder will begin to heat up
Once the nozzle reaches high enough and melts the filament, the printer will sound a beep and you can unload the filament by pressing down the spring presser and withdrawing the filament. (Note: Do not pull out the filament with force as it will damage the gears. If the melted filament has cooled down in the extruder, please repeat the steps above.)
Open the filament cartridge from the back, replace it with a new spool and close the cartridge. (Note: if the spool cannot fit in the cartridge, you can put it over the white spool holder.)
Go to Tools -> Filament, select ""Load"" and wait the extruder's temperature reaches 200 C
The printer will sound a beep to prompt you to load the filament into the extruder
Push filament vertically into the extruder at an upright angle
Press ""Done"", when you see filament come out of the extruder (Note: Do not tap ""Done"" until the filament loads the extruder steadily.)
Troubleshooting
To clean the tray:
Take an alcohol wipe and wipe down the tray. Don't be too afraid to press kind of hard (not too hard) to get all the residue off.
Certain wipes will leave residue; clean it off with a paper towel before printing again.
Printer head is clogged:
Haven't had to do this yet. If you think this is your only option, contact ICommons Support at ihelp@drexel.edu or by visiting the desk in the Commons.
Spool is stuck (""Tck.. Tck.. Tck.."" Sound):
Take out the spool and check to see if the plastic is crossed over onto itself not allowing it to come out.
If so, unload the filament from Tools > Filament > Unload.
Press down the spring on the left side of the printing head and pull out the filament.
Sometimes loading in the filament or preheating can help you unload if you are having trouble.
Cut the end of the filament.
Fix the cross over in the spool.
Load the filament back into the printer head by going to Tools > Filament > Load and slowly pushing in the filament.

Printing and Copying with PaperCut Printers
Tagged with: papercut copy print
Printing from PaperCut is very similar to printing normally, but there are some minor differences. These instructions apply to Macs, PCs, iOS and Android devices, as well as Chrome OS systems.
The first difference you'll notice when printing is that you no longer have separate printers for the different copy rooms - now, the only printers you will see are the ""CCI Color"" and ""CCI BW"" printers. Instead of printing to a specific printer, you simply choose whether you want to print in black and white or in color. You can then walk to either printer and release your print job.

When printing from a Drexel Mac or PC, you can access advanced printing options just as you have in the past, for finishing options such as stapling and sorting.
After submitting a print job, you may be asked for your Drexel username and password. This will ensure that only you can print your documents when you get to the printer.

Once you've submitted your print job, and possibly authenticated with your Drexel credentials, you can go to either copy room to print your documents. Most faculty and staff have already been imported into the system and will be able to simply scan their DragonCard to log in, as shown below; you can also log in with your Drexel credentials if you don't have your card.

If your card is not recognized, you will be asked to log in using your Drexel credentials. This will record your card number so you can scan your card in the future.

Once logged into PaperCut, you can choose ""Print Release"" or ""Access Device"", as shown below:

To print things you have submitted to the queue, choose ""Print Release"". This will bring you to your personal print queue, where you can choose to print documents you have submitted to the print queue. You can also choose to print as grayscale or convert a print to two-sided printing if desired.

To use the copier as a copier or scanner, choose ""Access Device"". This will give you the copier's standard interface, as you may have used before.

Adding PaperCut Printers to a non-Drexel computer
To install PaperCut printers on personal Macs or PCs, or to install PaperCut printers on ChromeOS, Android and iOS devices, you must use the MobilityPrint configuration tool. This will give you basic functionality; if you need to use staplers or finishers on the CCI Copiers, please use the dedicated instructions for your platform at Printing with PaperCut.
First, visit the MobilityPrint setup page at MobilityPrint Setup. You will automatically be directed to the correct configuration for your computer type, and will be provided instructions on adding the printers specific to your operating system. If the wrong operating system is chosen, you can manually choose another OS at the bottom of the page.

Poster Printing
Tagged with: cci commons printing poster printing
CCI faculty & staff can ask for a poster to be printed for Drexel instructional, business, administrative, marketing, or research purposes, including conferences and presentations.
CCI students can have posters printed for Senior Design or official research conference purposes, or if they are working on behalf of a CCI faculty or staff member & need the poster for instructional, business, administrative, marketing, or research purposes, including conferences and presentations.
Please note:
A minimum of 2 business day notice is required to accommodate printing requests. We will do what we can, but we make no promises for shorter turnaround time,
For fastest turnaround time, we posters should have maximum dimensions of 44”x66” or 44 inches x 66 inches.
We may be able to print larger than that, but one side has to be 44"" or less for sure, and it will take more time to print and cut off any excess paper.
NOTE: The poster printer paper cutter only cuts 50"" and less. And our printer only prints out a max width of 44"". We can cut larger posters, and have posters whose longer side is longer than 66"", but if it's much longer or larger, we may not be able to accommodate.
Files must be submitted in PDF, PNG, JPEG, PPT, or PPTX formats.
If we have to upscale the image, because the file you sent us is not at the dimensions you want, it will take us more time to print, and we may have to request you give us a better file, or the resulting poster may appear pixelated or fuzzy. We do have ways to change to vector-like graphics or use free AI websites to upscale some images, but pixelation and fuzziness is still a danger.
Posters will NOT be mounted on foam board. External vendors should be contacted separately by
requestor.
PROCESS: Faculty/staff should submit the following information to ihelp@drexel.edu 
PDF, PNG, JPEG, PPT, or PPTX of your poster file, sized correctly for printing
Confirmation of dimension size
Date needed by
Your email address to notify when complete
Purpose for printing (e.g. Research Day, Senior Design, Conference, etc.)
Other pertinent details you think necessary.
You will be notified via the email address provided when your request is complete.
When the poster has finished printing it will be rolled up and rubber banded.
You will be able to pick it up in the CCI Commons lab in 3675 Market Room 1060 (Hours M-F: 8:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m.)."

How to Change/Replace Filament
Loading Filament
From Home Menu.
Go to Utilities -> Change Cart -> Load Filament.
Open the top cover.

Insert filament into the feeder gear.

Filament is past the point the feeder gears can do anything with it.

Activate LOAD FILAMENT function on the printer.
Then, press OK > Apply Settings, then OK.

Wait for the extruder to heat up.

While the temperature reaches the operating setting, the printer loads the filament automatically, and filament loading is completed
Check if the filament flows out from the nozzle
If the filament has flowed out, please press ""OK"" to complete the loading process
Unloading/Replacing Filament 
From Home Menu
Go to Menu -> Utilities -> Change Cart -> Unload Filament
Wait for the extruder to heat up to operating temperature
When ""PULLOUT FILAMENT"" is displayed on the screen, press the release arm and pull out the filament
Remove the filament spool from the holder and replace a new one (behind the 3D printer)

Then follow the Loading Filament instruction above to load the filament
Still Not Loaded?
If the filament is not fully loaded, meaning it is not in the extruder
You can simply push the black latch near the filament hole and pull the filament out
Otherwise, follow the next instruction to unload the filament
In most cases, the filament will be stuck in between the plastic tubing and the actual extruder.
See how the filament isn't feeding into the metal funnel top hole within the extruder in the picture below?

In order to fix this, you'll need to cut the filament by lifting up the black tab above the extruder.

The black & blue push fitting is zip-tied to another zip tie to hold it to the black plastic top of the extruder mount. White PVC tube feeds into the push fitting, and the 3D filament goes through the tube, through the push fitting, into a smaller PVC tube, and down into the extruder mount and into the extruder
Shut off the printer and unplug the wires going into the extruder
Top zip tie cut that connected to other zip tie connected to black plastic on top of the extruder. You can pull the tubes connected on either side of the black & blue push fitting and you'll see the filament (black filament here) that was in the tube. This filament can't be pulled out by hand... yet. There's a melted and now cooled glob of filament at the bottom preventing you from pulling it through.

Use the Load Filament option to get filament that won't pull out, well, pulled out. Go to Utilities, then press OK > Change Cart, then press OK > Load Filament, then press OK > Apply Settings, then press OK

The extruder will be heating up in Load Filament Mode

Once the Temperature gets around 150 C, grab the 3D filament that you cannot pull out of the extruder and push the 3D filament back down into the extruder for a half-second and then pull back on the 3D filament back from the extruder for a half-second. Keep repeating the pushdown & pull out.


You'll feel the filament go down a little more than normal (usually) and/or then be able to pull the filament out again. Filament out here.

Remove the 3D filament from the tube 

Stop the Loading by pressing OK. Takes a lot of pressing. Sometimes doesn't stop until function time is over on DaVinci printer
Do not keep the filament fitted through the blue spool holder like this, before or after changing the filament.

Removed the blue filament spool holder from back. You have to twist the filament a certain way to get it through hole to the gears, through the gears, press the metal gear release, and through the hole to the white tube. It helps a lot to cut a 45-degree or more acute angle on the end of the filament.

Got 3d filament about 1 inch into the white PVC tube

3D filament all the way through the tube

3d blue filament spool holder placed to the side of large hole. Do NOT feed through spool holder hole. Constrains filament too much when you try to twist the 3d filament to get it in.

3d filament is being reinserted into the extruder again, but often gets stopped because the filament gets stuck off to the side


So use something to guide the filament into the metal hole.

Zip tie the push fitting to the other zip tie attached to the top hole of the black plastic of the 3d extruder mount.

Move the extruder and extruder mount to the position shown here before starting the print (or even using the Loading position after reloading the filament).

Now run the Load Filament option again. No to Utilities, then press OK > Change Cart, then press OK > Load Filament, then press OK > Apply Settings, then press OK.
Calibrating
Use the filament clippers to trim the nozzle of any dried or hardened 3d printer filament. May want to use the wire brushes on the nozzle. No need to remove the nozzle or extruder from the mount or 3d printer.
Use the Z-Index function first on the printer, with a folded over sheet of printer paper, and put the nozzle over each screw, starting with the front screw, then left-back, then right-back, then just in the middle. You want the folder piece of printer paper to move easily between bed and nozzle but otherwise the bed and nozzle to be as close as possible. And the paper should move with no snagging or effort.
For this first go-around, use the Z-index function to move the nozzle and bed closer or farther from one another. With the Z-index function, the up arrow moves the bed down. Down arrow moves bed up.
For the center of the bed, don’t make any adjustments unless the paper snags at all. If it does, make adjustments, but do all 3 screws using Z-index again, and *then* go onto the next step.
Now, you’ll adjust the distance between the bed and nozzle again over each of the 3 adjustment screws under the bed, and the center of the bed, using the folded over piece of paper again to gauge the distance between the bed level and the nozzle, but now, you’ll use the white wing nuts on the 3 screws under the bed. Start with the front, then do back-left, then right-left. Right-tighty (if looking down over the bed) on the wing nut makes the bed go up. Left-loosey (looking down over the bed) makes the bed go down. You want the folded sheet of paper to move smoothly without snagging at all between the bed and the nozzle, but only just. Do this over each of the adjustment screws, using the white wing nut of the screw to make the adjustment.
Again, when you gauge the center of the bed, you just want the piece of paper to move freely. Don’t tighten anything if the paper moves freely when gauging the center. But if the paper snags, repeat all of this.
A great file to do a test print after calibration is the “Retraction Test” at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:909901

Troubleshooting
Tearing Build Tape
Expect it. Accept it. Try not to rip it. Be patient as you use the scrapers. But it’ll rip.
When it does, gently try to straighten the crunched-up tape, to flatten it and pull it back over the whole.
And use the spatulas to flatten it (swipe towards you with the blade down on the surface, or swipe in the opposite direction of the tear with the blade down). This can work great to really flatten the tape and get some more prints in before changing it.
If you have 1 hole larger than an inch in diameter, you have to change the bed tape.  If you have 2 holes larger than 0.5 inches in diameter, you have to change the bed tape. And we mean holes you can’t flatten the tape over again.
3D Print really stuck to build tape?
Find a small thin piece of the 3d print and gently but firmly get the spatula under the top of the thin piece.
Go slow! But firm. Try to feel when you are tearing. You can repair little tears (and re-repair frequently) by pulling scrunched bed tape back over the tear. Big tears are harder to repair.
No small thin piece of the 3d print? Use the corner of the spatula blade and wedge it back and forth under one of the ends of the 3D print."

Papercut -- Cannot Print to Black & White or CCIBW or BW
Tagged with: papercut printing
When printing to the black and white queue on PaperCut, you may come across an error (similar but not exact results to the photo) where the page shows up as a glitched color page. Other glitches may also occur. This problem happens often in Chrome since it defaults the browser to print in color despite choosing to print in black and white. This issue can occur when trying to print to CCIBW - the PaperCut black and white printer.

In order to fix this error:
The web browser should have an option (most likely dropdown menu but others as well) to ask if you want to print in color or black and white.
Select to print in black and white for the black and white printer.
When printing black and white to the PaperCut black and white printers, CCIBW, double check that the web browser is set to print in black and white."

Adding PaperCut Printers to a non-Drexel computer
To install PaperCut printers on personal Macs or PCs, or to install PaperCut printers on ChromeOS, Android and iOS devices, you must use the MobilityPrint configuration tool. This will give you basic functionality; if you need to use staplers or finishers on the CCI Copiers, please use the dedicated instructions for your platform at Printing with PaperCut.
First, visit the MobilityPrint setup page at MobilityPrint Setup. You will automatically be directed to the correct configuration for your computer type, and will be provided instructions on adding the printers specific to your operating system. If the wrong operating system is chosen, you can manually choose another OS at the bottom of the page.


Note: After the steps above, Mobility Print will ask to register account in order to adding papercut printers."

Adding PaperCut printers to a Drexel Mac
Tagged with: papercut printing macOS
Most faculty and staff should have the new PaperCut printers show up automatically when their Drexel managed Mac connects to the Drexel network. If it is not installed automatically, you can follow the below steps to add it manually.
Open Self Service from your Applications folder or Launchpad. Its icon looks like this: 
Next, log into Jamf with your Drexel username and password:

Once logged in, a list of available applications will appear. Among these, you should see an application called ""CCICopiers Installer"". If this has already been installed, the text beneath it will say ""reinstall"". If your computer has never had the printers installed, it will say ""Install"". Click either the ""Install"" or ""Reinstall"" button to add the printers to your Mac.

If all went well, you should see two new printers on your Mac. To check, navigate to System Preferences, in the Applications folder or Launchpad. Its icon looks like this:

Click on the ""Printers and Scanners"" preference pane:
You should see two printers, CCI Color and CCI BW. If you do, continue to ((link_to_how_to_print_with_papercut))."

Printing to Papercut with Linux
Printing to PaperCut from Linux requires that your Linux username match your Drexel or Tux username; if it does not, your print jobs will not be assigned to your queue and cannot be retrieved. Adding the PaperCut printers is as simple as running the following commands. The generic PPD file we use can be downloaded at PaperCut Generic PPD for Linux.
For systems that use Drexel or Tux credentials, use the following commands:

lpadmin -p ""CCI-BW"" -E -v 'lpd://papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20BW' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd
lpadmin -p ""CCI-Color"" -E -v 'lpd://papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20Color' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd

For systems using nonstandard usernames, you must add your Drexel or Tux username in the command, replacing <<userid>> in the following commands:

lpadmin -p ""CCI-BW"" -E -v 'lpd://<<userid>>@papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20BW' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd
lpadmin -p ""CCI-Color"" -E -v 'lpd://<<userid>>@papercut.cci.drexel.edu/CCI%20Color' -P /etc/cups/ppd/generic.ppd

This has been tested on Ubuntu, but should work on other distros. We only officially support Ubuntu."

Printing and Copying with PaperCut Printers
Tagged with: papercut copy print
Printing from PaperCut is very similar to printing normally, but there are some minor differences. These instructions apply to Macs, PCs, iOS and Android devices, as well as Chrome OS systems.
The first difference you'll notice when printing is that you no longer have separate printers for the different copy rooms - now, the only printers you will see are the ""CCI Color"" and ""CCI BW"" printers. Instead of printing to a specific printer, you simply choose whether you want to print in black and white or in color. You can then walk to either printer and release your print job.

When printing from a Drexel Mac or PC, you can access advanced printing options just as you have in the past, for finishing options such as stapling and sorting.
After submitting a print job, you may be asked for your Drexel username and password. This will ensure that only you can print your documents when you get to the printer.

Once you've submitted your print job, and possibly authenticated with your Drexel credentials, you can go to either copy room to print your documents. Most faculty and staff have already been imported into the system and will be able to simply scan their DragonCard to log in, as shown below; you can also log in with your Drexel credentials if you don't have your card.

If your card is not recognized, you will be asked to log in using your Drexel credentials. This will record your card number so you can scan your card in the future.

Once logged into PaperCut, you can choose ""Print Release"" or ""Access Device"", as shown below:

To print things you have submitted to the queue, choose ""Print Release"". This will bring you to your personal print queue, where you can choose to print documents you have submitted to the print queue. You can also choose to print as grayscale or convert a print to two-sided printing if desired.

To use the copier as a copier or scanner, choose ""Access Device"". This will give you the copier's standard interface, as you may have used before.

CCI Raspberry Pi Documentation
Overview
Raspberry Pi's Drexel CCI Summer Digital Development campers are getting the Raspberry Pi 400 Keyboard.
Has a Raspberry Pi 4 inside. Not 4B. 4. CPU is Raspberry Pi (BCM2711 1.8Ghz). 4GB of RAM. WiFi and Ethernet.
You plug the cords in, connect to an HDMI monitor, they should just take you through set-up. 
Update may fail on 1st try, if not fully connect to network yet. Below is how to run update later.
Not showing up on TV/monitor/projector? See Tips below
Beginner's Guide to Raspberry Pi Book Included with Raspberry Pi 400 Keyboards
Overview of Pi OS.
Lots of examples of Scratch programming in Pi OS. 
Lots of examples of Python programming in Pi OS.
Thonny IDE & Scratch apps built-in to PI OS.
Easily lets you code & run Python & Scratch programs.
Other programming IDE's built-in as well.
Also, Using your Raspberry Pi - Overview website below
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-using/1
Pi Tip #1: if Pi Doesn't Show on a TV or Monitor
Plug in all the cords (HDMI, mouse, power) & make sure power LED on keyboard is lit.
Connect via HDMI to a TV or monitor or projector.
If no signal, unplug the power cord ONLY from the keyboard.
Wait 5 seconds. 
Plug the power back in.
That often sends a signal to the TV or monitor if nothing else worked.
Pi Tip #2: Put an HDMI coupler on the end of an HDMI cord to a TV/Monitor
Lets you easily plug Raspberry PI HDMI to another HDMI cord without unplugging the TV/Monitor HDMI cord.
CCI cannot give away HDMI couplers to Digital Developer Campers but we can provide one near TV's if people are playing with PI's.
Pi Tip #3: Pi screen went black
Pi's default screen saver is just completely blank.
Tap on a key on the keyboard.
Pi Tip #4: How to tell what type of Raspberry Pi you have
Press CTRL+ALT+T on your Pi's attached keyboard (may need USB keyboard).
Type in this command, then press Enter/Return. 
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep Model
More info at: https://raspberrytips.com/which-raspberry-pi-model/
Pi Tip #5: How to tell how much RAM my PI has
Press CTRL+ALT+T on your Pi's attached keyboard (may need USB keyboard).
Type in this command, then press Enter/Return. 
free -h
More info at: https://thechrisgreen.com/2021/01/how-to-check-the-ram-on-your-raspberry-pi/
Pi Tip #6: PI Password change? Not worthy it until you are really using it.
Don't make any new userids or passwords until you actually have some important data or info on the pi. 
If you just got your Pi, go with the defaults. Makes your life easier.
pi is username, raspberry is password. 
Can always change the password later by going to
Raspberry Pi logo (upper left) > Preferences >  Raspberry Pi Configuration > System > Change Password
Rare we ever tell anyone to not set a password, FYI.
Pi Tip #7: How to Update Raspberry Pi OS
Press CTRL+ALT+T on your Pi's attached keyboard (may need USB keyboard).
In Pi Terminal, type in the following:
sudo apt update
y
y
sudo reboot
Initially, all we'd recommend UNLESS you run into issues.
For more, see: https://raspberryexpert.com/update-raspberry-pi/
NOTES:
        ""sudo apt full-upgrade"" will take 20 minutes.
        Cleaning out logs and remnants not needed unless you do the app upgrade.
        SKIP THE ""Update Raspberry Pi EEPROM"" SECTION"". 
If prompt says reboot your Pi,
        but Progress in Terminal window is NOT 100%,
        click OK at prompt
        but do NOT reboot your PI.
Pi Tip #8: Time Adjustment
If your Raspberry Pi's time is not set correctly follow these steps:
Type sudo raspi-config in the Raspberry Pi command line
Internationalization options
Change Time Zone
Select geographical area
Select city or region
Reboot your pi
Pi Tip #9: WiFi
Digital Development Campers! You will need to use the drexelguest WiFi network, not dragonfly3 or anything else.
drexelguest WiFi Network Connection Tip: 
If Drexel guest email login page does not appear...
Go to the webpage below in a web browser.
http://neverssl.com
Use http not https. The website is safe.
That should redirect you to the Drexel guest email login page.
Be sure you are on drexelguest WiFi.
No password needed for Drexelguest network. An email is needed.
Cannot connect to dragonfly3 or is it greyed out?
Some Raspberry Pis cannot connect to WPA2 Enterprise level WiFi connections that require special log-ins.
The best case would be to attempt to manually add it. However, that's often tricky or ends in failure still.
Here is the link if you want to give it a shot: 
https://iceburn.medium.com/raspberry-pi-connected-to-wifi-of-wpa2-enterprise-ddd5a40c0b07
Drexel CCI's Support page on Android WiFi may provide how to do this here.
https://support.cci.drexel.edu/getting-connected/general-issues/connecting-dragonfly3-wifi-drexel-campus/connecting-dragonfly3-wifi-drexel-campus-android/
Finally, see Drexel's WiFi manual configuraiton page
Otherwise, try using drexelguest or connecting to dragonfly3 via Ethernet, which is the best solution as Raspberry Pi's wifi cards are not always the best.

Pi Tip #10: Find IP Address for your Raspberry PI
hostname -I
or
ifconfig
If you do ifconfig, look at the 1st line UNDER ""wlan0,"" next to ""inet"" for your IP address, if you are on WiFi. If on ethernet wired internet, look under ""eth0,"" next to ""inet"" for your IP address.

Pi Tip #11: If you do NOT have a Raspberry Pi 400 (or Pi pre-installed inside a keyboard)
Your PI may need a wired USB keyboard and mouse, and a power charger.
Pi's 1 and 2 and Pico often do not have built-in WiFi. 1 and 2 have an Ethernet cord. Newer Pico's have Wifi.
You may not even have a case for some PI's until you buy or create one.

IMPORTANT!
RECOMMEND HIGHLY: Getting another 16 GB or larger microSD card.
Use that separate microSD card Raspberry PI OS for 1 or more of the projects below.
You may want to get a separate microSD card for each project below.
Also, 1-2 of these projects actually use a different OS than Raspberry PI OS (like Mycroft).
Downloading & Using Raspberry Pi OS Imaging Software
DELETES all exisitng data, Pi OS, programs or apps on microSD card.
Starts with fresh Raspberry PI OS.
See ""Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi"" section at link below.
You can do this on Mac or Linux, as well as Windows.
SKIP the ""Installing Pi-hole Over SSH"" & ""Setting Network Connections for Pi-hole"" sections (unless installing Pi-hole)
https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-pi-hole-raspberry-pi
To start download the Raspberry Pi Imager located here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/

Imaging a MicroSD Card
After that, you will want to plug your MicroSD card into your computer. If you do not have a MicroSD/SD card reader on your computer we have a microSD to USB B adapter which will allow you to image the MicroSD.
You will want to then select the Operating System you would like to image on the MicroSD by clicking the white button ""Choose OS"". 
After that select the storage device which will usually be called some sort of MicroSD or Mass Storage Device depending if you are using the adapter. Finally hit ""Write"" and the imaging process will begin. If for any reason the ""Write"" button is not clickable that means you have not properly selected an image file or storage device.
Once the MicroSD is imaged, place it into the slot on the Raspberry Pi and boot it up following the proper instructions for that image.
Imaging Using a Custom .iso File
The imaging software gives you a good amount to select from, but if you are installing a more unique image feel free to download it normally and then scroll to the option ""Use custom"" where it will allow you to manually select the image file on your computer

Wireless Display from Pi To Android or iOS
Wireless display from your Pi to an Android or iOS phone is very possible through VNC, BUT...
The Pi and the Android or iOS device have to be on the same network.
drexelguest network will not allow VNC to work, and we can't use any other network with Digital Development Campers on Drexel Campus. But they should have no issue doing this on their own network at home.
The links below will tell you how.

See above tips section for how to find the IP address of your PI.
Remoting into a Raspberry Pi from Another Computer
Introduction
Remoting into the Raspberry Pi is extremely useful to use if you do not have any additional peripherals for an additional setup explicitly for the Raspberry Pi. As long as SSH is enabled on the Raspberry Pi and you know the Raspberry Pi's IP address then it is as simple as opening up a command prompt or using Microsoft's RDP program and entering the IP and credentials.

OCR or Select Text Out Of Images or PDFs
Intro
You can OCR scan a PDF by making a screenshot of it in macOS Monterey
Instructions
MacOs
Most Macs do not do automatic OCR of PDF's.
Using Mac Preview, you can completely OCR scan (make selectable text you can copy) on any PDF, or any image with text on it.
No downloads. No tweaks. No changes to settings.
Open the PDF or whatever file or image or video has text on it.
Take a screenshot using Cmd+Shift+4 or Cmd+Shift+3, or whatever built-in Mac screenshot mechanism you prefer.
Now just open the screenshot.
The screenshot will automatically have selectable text you can copy.
You can do this with anything you can take a screenshot of on your Mac.
This seems to be a feature for Monterey and above only, though.
https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/interact-with-text-in-a-photo-prvw625a5b2c/mac

Adobe Acrobat Pro does this, but takes some additional tweaks and steps often.
Windows user alternative
Adobe Acrobat Pro, of course, but also...
Google Photos, when viewing an image in your web browser, as of April or last year, provides a copy text from image button. Not bad, honestly.
Mobile apps like Office Lens or Google Lens or Adobe's version also work.
Pixel users (maybe others on Android) have Lens built into Google Photos, but since you can open Photos in a Desktop web browser and copy text, that might be the better way to go.
iOS/iPhones/iPads let you select text in photos and copy to your Mac without any additional apps.

International-Related Internet Connection Issues
Possible Solutions
Drexel CCI has students from all over the world, and the online tools we use sometimes can run into issues with the infrastructure, policies, or providers in countries outside the United States.
Here are some possible solutions:
Try our suggestions for those internet connection speed or reliability issues within the US.
Many of the same strategies we recommend to those who are in the US could be viable for those living outside the US.
WiFi Internet or Web Speed Issues at Home or Apartment
If you want to test any of these, or just have further questions or run into issues implementing these, reach out to ihelp@drexel.edu if you want to arrange a test Zoom or Ultra or other call with us.
Let us know if you are not in the United States, and then what time zone you are in.
Try setting the Cloudflare 1.1.1.1. DNS resolving address as your primary DNS address on your computer.
Changing DNS
Disable location services in your web browser.
Anecdotal evidence is that it helps improve Zoom or Ultra or streaming meeting video quality if you are in China or parts of Asia. Possibly other countries and applications as well.
This is how you do it without the little prompt asking in the major web browsers if you want to share your location or not.
https://www.lifewire.com/denying-access-to-your-location-4027789
Using Zoom? Issues still? As last resort, try disabling end-to-end encryption in Zoom on your end.
Maybe ask the instructor to do so as well.
The encryption could possibly again slow things down further if you are having issues.
The Zoom live stream is still fairly secure.
Try as last resort.
Anyway, you can try these on your own, or again, try reaching out to ihelp@drexel.edu if you want someone to test these out or if you need help or have questions enabling them.
ONLY students taking Drexel CCI classes should email ihelp@drexel.edu. 
Secondary Work-Around Solutions
Try the above suggestions first.
If the suggestions above do not resolve the issue, the following work-around solutions may need to be employed.
Instructors, be prepared to allow students to watch lecture recordings rather than live streams, or work asynchronously on labs.
Confirm you can login to Bb Learn at https://learn.dcollege.net (or Partners Bb Learn at https://partners.dcollege.net ).
Use your Drexel userid and password (or Partners Bb Learn email and password).
Have instructor share direct Unlisted links to videos uploaded to Kaltura Drexel Streams, which works with Drexel and non-Drexel users.
Kaltura Drexel Streams -- Sharing Kaltura Audio or Video with Non-Drexel Users
Test video you can share with students to test this: https://1513041.mediaspace.kaltura.com/edit/1_9wpezg2v
Instructors, try live streams in and record, or pre-record lectures in Bb Collaborate Ultra within the Bb Learn course section.
Send a test link to student to the recording to confirm access.
Live Ultra Use: Bb Collaborate Ultra
Ultra Pre-Record: Bb Collaborate Ultra -- Pre-Record Lectures in Bb Collaborate Ultra
Access Recordings in Ultra (Instructors and Students: Bb Collaborate Ultra -- Accessing Recordings)
Instructors, try uploading recorded videos to OneDrive in your web browser at https://portal.office.com .
Click the *cloud* or “OneDrive” icon in left nav panel.
You could can create a folder in OneDrive and upload videos there, and share the folder with certain Drexel students or Drexel individuals. If you need to share with any non-Drexel students or individuals, set access so anyone with link can access it. You can set a password as well if you wish.
See Office 365 -- OneDrive Sharing Files and Folders
Instructors, try all the above first, but if not feasible, upload mp4 files directly to Bb Learn. Click ""Build Content"" > ""Video"" in a ""Week"" or other content area.
Ask student or end user if they can access that.
This slows down Bb Learn for all users, so this should not be done unless a last resort.
Work with international student or end user. Ask them if they have a cloud storage or video storage service that works for them.
If a 1 GB or 2 GB or other size video file is too big, Handbrake easily lets you down convert. See link below.

Properly Update Windows 10 & Drivers in Windows 10
Introduction
For Windows 10 users only. Windows 10 automatic updates are NOT great. Once a month, it's a good idea to manually check for Windows updates. Drivers are what allow the hardware on your computer to interact with the software on your computer. Drivers can have bugs or be corrupted or get the wrong version or software, and they need to updated. And sometimes, your BIOS (sort of the operating system in which your operating system runs) also needs to be updated. This page covers the best ways to do this.
Note: BIOS and other firmware updates probably only need to be updated once a year, or every 6 months or so. Many will tell you that you only need to do such updates if you have issues or notice some slowdown. So if you don't feel comfortable updating your BIOS or firmware -- OR DRIVERS! -- and have no issues, do NOT do so. :-)
Normal Windows 10 Updating
For normal Widows updates, do the following:
Click Start icon or . Then Settings or > Update & Security > Windows Update .
Or click Start > Settings > Windows Update
The link below will also tell you how to update Window 10 normally.
And TROUBLESHOOT common issues.
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-windows-3c5ae7fc-9fb6-9af1-1984-b5e0412c556a#WindowsVersion=Windows_10
Pushing Windows 10 for More Updates
You can also ""push"" Windows 10 a little bit for more updates.
Do the Normal Windows 10 Update, as mentioned above, EXCEPT...
On the Windows Update page, click the blue ""Check online for updates from Microsoft Update"" link, shown in the screenshot below, if visible to you.
****ALSO*****
Be sure to click ""Optional Updates"" (after doing the above), and click the > next to ""Drivers"".
Updating Multiple Drivers through Widows 10 - Drexel Machines and Non-Drexel Machines
Both Windows 10's Update system, and the Software Center application we use on Drexel-owned or -managed machines, are *TERRIBLE* at updating drivers from OEM manufacturers. (OEM = original equipment manufacturers).
But you should perform these updates as well, once a month or so. And we recommend check them manually, and while on Drexel's VPN.
For how to update Windows 10 drivers, see the excellent Windows Central page below:
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-properly-update-device-drivers-windows-10#page1
Drexel Machines ONLY - Updating through Software Center
Drexel machine users CAN use the methods mentioned above to update their Windows computers.
Drexel Machines Only (if Drexel owns or specifically manages your computer), check for updates in Software Center as well for one or more driver or firmware updates:
Get on Drexel's VPN.
Click the Start menu or Windows menu, and search for ""Software Center"" (no quotes).
Or look in the Applications or Programs in the Start or Windows menu for the ""Microsoft Endpoint Manager"" or ""Microsoft Endpoint"" folder,  and look for ""Software Center"" there.
In ""Software Center,"" go to ""Updates.""
Run any updates there.
Reboot when finished.
Advanced: Update Multiple Drivers Simultaneously
-->NOT for DIY custom-built PC's!!!!!!!!!! <---
Windows 10's normal update does a terrible job of updating drivers of the machine. You should try that later (and run Windows 10 update manually about once/month), but here is how to efficiently update drivers from the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) or company that made your laptop or desktop, or major components for it.
Download, install, and run the hwinfo program.

reach out to ihelp@drexel.edu if you want to arrange a test Zoom or Ultra or other call with us.
ONLY students taking Drexel CCI classes, or faculty and staff working for Drexel CCI, should email ihelp@drexel.edu.
Update Windows 10 & make sure your particular computer manufacturer's & CPU & GPU drivers and firmware are updated (beyond just running Windows 10 updates).
See Properly Update Drivers in Windows 10
Move yourself closer to your home internet router/modem.
If you have a choice between 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz WiFi networks at home, try both to see what is better.
Note that 2.4 GHz travels farther than 5 GHz but 5 GHz often can provide a better internet signal.
Quit or close any unnecessary apps, especially ones used for social media or messaging.
Close any web browser tabs and windows you are not using.
A wired connection is more dependable and still often provides better service than WiFi.
Many routers or modems let you plug an Ethernet or LAN cord in the back, and those are super cheap.
You can get cheap adapters for USB-to-Ethernet or USB-C-to-Ethernet if your computer does not have an Ethernet port.

Try using your mobile device for internet.
Use the HotSpot feature on Android & iPhone.
Use Zoom or Ultra on your cellphone or mobile device itself, though, if possible.
If you have ""unlimited"" internet through your cellphone provider,
you can use Zoom or Ultra or Bb Learn on your mobile device.

You don’t need 5G for Zoom or Ultra or the like.
We could do a test Zoom or Ultra call or the like with you if you want. Email ihelp@drexel.edu if you are taking CCI classes or are a CCI staff or faculty member.

Avoid using video during Zoom or Ultra meetings.
Use your phone for audio in Zoom and Ultra, rather than your computer microphone.
Reduce your own screen resolution on your computer.

Many cities and towns have a lot of public WiFi options.
The public WiFi might be a better option.
Being outdoors in Fall, Spring, and Summer can often be a very viable option, at least in a pinch.
Google places or look on Yelp for what has WiFi.
Use the Drexel VPN for better security when on a public wifi network,
like Starbucks or a borough of NYC or Philly.
ONLY works if you have a Drexel account or are a Drexel student, employee, instructor, or faculty member.
Once connected to Drexel’s VPN, you are safer from snoopers on the same WiFi network.
More on Drexel VPN
VPN usually slows the connection down, though.
So if VPN makes it worse, the secure(s) part of https websites that Drexel uses is pretty effective as well,
and does a decent job of keeping your info private in Zoom sessions or using Bb Learn,
though people may know what websites you go to, if they use a packet sniffer like Wireshark.
Close any open web browser tabs you are not using & close any applications you are not using.
If there application or web browser add-ons you are not using, uninstall those, when you get the chance.
Run an internet speed test. There are various ones, but one example is Google's Speed Test.
For Zoom or Bb Collaborate Ultra or Teams virtual video conference,
you definitely need 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload.
Other similar apps will need that as well.
Try disconnecting any other devices on the internet while you are on a Zoom or Ultra call or the like,
especially if you don't have very fast internet.
You may also want to test for internet or web packet loss:
See Testing internet or web packet loss.
If you do not have that speed of internet & should, reach out to your internet provider.
If you cannot afford greater internet speed, ask about low-income internet options from your internet provider.
An advanced option:
Apply Cloudflare 1.1.1.1. DNS resolving address as your primary DNS address on your computer.
This OFTEN stabilizes internet connectivity issues (at least to some degree).
See Changing DNS - Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 and Drexel DNS.
Another advanced option (Windows 10 only):
Change the IRPStackSize.
See Improve Network Speed in Windows 10 by Increasing IRPStackSize.

If you are NOT 100% comfortable or confident with regedit.msc, do NOT use the above website. You can have irretrievable damage and even irrepairable damage to your computer by screwing around with your system registry.
Email ihelp@drexel.edu, and give us some details, we *might* be able to suggest other ideas.
(Like maybe a cheap-ish device to turn electric outlets into internet conveyance for a more dependable wired connection, but there could be security issues.)
We can’t promise anything, but we’d be happy to try and offer advice for this.
We are also happy to help you test any of the suggestions above, or have further questions"

Matterport & 360 camera instructions - virtual tour -- Article Listing
Instructions
Set up your 360 camera
Gather and assemble all equipment and software
360 camera -- if you are the INSTA360 ONE X, you will need to insert a formatted SD card before scanning 
Tripod
Supported Apple iPad or iPhone -- Iphone 6s or later , Ipad Pro, 6th generation, Air 2, or later
Matterport Capture App -- Download Matterport from the App Store
Set Tripod to eye level -- 5ft or 1.5m high, make sure that the tripod legs are stable 
Attach the 360 camera to the tripod -- make sure that the camera is well fastened.
Pair your iOS device with your 360 camera --Settings -> Wi-Fi -> Select Camera's Wi-Fi network
Scan a Space
Open the Matterport App on your iOS device
Click on ""+"" icon at the bottom right of the screen
A new window will open up, fill out the optional description fields -- you can also fill them out later
Click on ""Save"" to continue 
Choose your starting point 
Click on ""Capture 3D Scan"" -- Make sure to leave the general area during the capture process, then will spin 360 degrees and will capture you if you are inside the scan radius
Choose the next placement point for your camera -- Move the camera 5-8ft from your starting point, make sure there is a clear line of sight to your starting point.
Repeat the last two steps until the property is scanned.
Note: The maximum supported number of scans is 200, or about 10,000 square feet. Sites nearing 200 scans typically take 24-48 hours to process. Consider splitting the site into two or more models.”
Also, when scanning areas with mirrors and windows, it is easier to mark the windows and mirrors as you go through rather than waiting until all the scans are done. You will have a chance of getting confused and putting a window or mirror in the wrong spot.
If you’re scanning an area with multiple floors, you will need to scan the stairs and start your second floor at the top of the stairs. Click to visit this link for more assistance about scanning an area with multiple floors.
Upload your scan 
When you are done scanning, turn off your camera, then connect your iOS device to the internet.
Log into Matter Cloud from Capture -- if you do not have an account, check your ""Welcome"" e-mail for instructions on creating a new account.
Mark all windows and mirrors -- Use the ""trim"" tool to crop out excess scan data for a clean finish. Make sure to place trim markers just outside of exterior walls.
Upload -- Click on  the ""Upload"" button to send the model to Matterport Cloud for processing. 
Matterport will construct a 3D space out of your scans, then e-mail you when it is completed. This usually takes a few hours.
